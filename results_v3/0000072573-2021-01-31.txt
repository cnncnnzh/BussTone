 In addition, foreign court decisions and regulatory actions could impact our ability to receive, transfer and process personal data relating to our employees and direct and indirect customers.

 For example, in July 2020 the European Union’s highest court, the European Court of Justice, invalidated the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which had replaced the previous  “safe harbor” relied upon by thousands of companies  to transfer personal information of European residents to the United States.

 The decision also called into question the validity of standard contractual clauses previously approved by the European Commission, which are utilized by the Company and are now the subject of additional review, debate, and revision.

[-1.1681181192398071, 0.6076554656028748, 1.5174118280410767]

 In addition, existing and proposed privacy and data protection laws and regulations result and may continue to result in significant compliance and operating costs and negative publicity for the Company and may subject it to remedies that may harm its business, including fines and orders to modify or cease existing business practices.

[-1.8317533731460571, 2.7963216304779053, -0.5396826267242432]

 The Company’s efforts to comply with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and other privacy and data protection laws may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could restrict the Company’s marketing activities and limit its service offerings.

[-1.8629652261734009, 2.7879316806793213, -0.38483452796936035]

 Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.

[-0.7461545467376709, 1.4174402952194214, -0.6907318830490112]

 The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact the Company through increased costs or restrictions on the Company’s business and its ability to acquire and interact with its customers, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.

[-1.8564444780349731, 2.4595396518707275, 0.2617731988430023]

 Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
