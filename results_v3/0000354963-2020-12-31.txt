 Californiaâ€™s Consumer Privacy Act and associated regulations, which became effective in 2020, under certain circumstances regulate the sale and disclosure of the personal information of California residents, grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances, and authorizes enforcement actions by the California Attorney General and certain private class actions.
