 The Company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing or use of consumer, customer, vendor or employee information or related data, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which goes into effect on January 1, 2020.

 The changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the Company to additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to the Company’s security systems, policies, procedures and practices.

 There is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the GDPR and the CCPA, because they are continuously developing and evolving.

 The changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as any other changes to existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, the Company to additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to the Company’s security systems, policies, procedures and practices.
