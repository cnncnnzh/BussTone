 In addition to the GLBA, we expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Such regulation may impose additional registration requirements and/or require us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices and afford consumers new abilities to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.

 In addition, the CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action under certain circumstances if their personal information is subject to a breach. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of these various state security breach laws.

 The consumer data we acquire, store, use, and provide subject us to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, the CCPA, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such data may also be subject to data privacy laws in international jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and certain countries in Europe.

 The CCPA, for example, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes new obligations on certain companies doing business in California with respect to the personal information of California residents. This includes new notice and privacy policy requirements, and new obligations to respond to requests to know and access to personal information, to delete personal information, and to say no to the sale of personal information.

 We expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulations similar to the GDPR and the CCPA that give consumers more control over their data. Compliance with these laws imposes significant regulatory burdens and costs on us.
