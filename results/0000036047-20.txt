 In addition to the GLBA, we expect that there will continue to be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

 In addition, the CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action under certain circumstances if their personal information is subject to a breach. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of these various state security breach laws.

 We acquire, store, use, and provide many types of consumer data and related services, some of which are subject to regulation under the FCRA, the GLBA, the CCPA and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace.

 The CCPA, for example, which became effective January 1, 2020, imposes new obligations on certain companies doing business in California with respect to the personal information of California residents. This includes new notice and privacy policy requirements, and new obligations to respond to requests to know and access to personal information, to delete personal information, and to say no to the sale of personal information.

 We expect that there will be enhanced state and/or federal regulation in the area of financial and consumer data privacy, including regulations similar to the GDPR, a data protection and privacy law in the European Union that became effective in 2018, and the CCPA. Compliance with these laws may impose significant regulatory burdens and costs on us.
