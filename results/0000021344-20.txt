We are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The interpretation and application of data privacy and data protection laws and regulations are often uncertain and are evolving in the United States and internationally.

 In the United States, the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, provides for a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information about California residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and to allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.

 The changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as any other changes to existing personal data protection or privacy laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices.

 Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in 14private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
