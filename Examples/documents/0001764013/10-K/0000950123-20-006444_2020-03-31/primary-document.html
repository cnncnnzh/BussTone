<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
company focused on enabling normal lives for patients with autoimmune diseases. We are developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RVT-1401),</FONT> that selectively binds
to and inhibits the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (&#147;FcRn&#148;). IMVT-1401 is the product of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (&#147;HanAll&#148;) to design a highly potent anti-FcRn
antibody optimized for subcutaneous delivery. These efforts have resulted in a product candidate that has been dosed in small volumes (e.g. 2 mL) and with a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">27-gauge</FONT> needle, while still generating
therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, IMVT-1401 has been observed to reduce
immunoglobulin G (&#147;IgG&#148;) antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe IMVT-1401 has the potential for broad application in related disease areas. We intend to
develop IMVT-1401 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Autoimmune diseases are conditions where an immune response is inappropriately directed against the body&#146;s own healthy cells and tissues. According to a
2012 study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, approximately 50&nbsp;million people in the United States suffer from one of more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Predisposing factors may include genetic susceptibility,
environmental triggers and other factors not yet known. Many of these diseases are associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, which are the most abundant type of antibody produced by the human immune system, accounting for
approximately 75% of antibodies in the plasma of healthy people. IgG antibodies are important in the defense against pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. In many autoimmune diseases, IgG antibodies inappropriately develop against normal proteins
found in the body, directing the immune system to attack specific organs or organ systems. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unfortunately, safe and effective treatment options for
patients suffering from autoimmune diseases are lacking. Currently available treatments are generally limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in early-stage disease and intravenous immunoglobulin (&#147;IVIg&#148;) or plasma exchange in
later-stage disease. These approaches often fail to address patients&#146; needs since they are limited by delayed onset of action, waning therapeutic benefit over time and unfavorable safety profiles. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FcRn plays a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies. The physiologic function of FcRn is to modulate the catabolism of IgG antibodies,
and inhibition of FcRn, such as through use of an anti-FcRn antibody, has been shown to reduce levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies. Completed clinical trials of Immunovant and other anti-FcRn antibodies in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases have generated promising results, suggesting that FcRn is a therapeutically important pharmacologic target to reduce levels of these disease-causing IgG antibodies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In several nonclinical studies and a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous and subcutaneous delivery of IMVT-1401 demonstrated
dose-dependent IgG antibody reductions and was observed to be well tolerated. In the highest dose cohort from the multiple-ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, four weekly subcutaneous administrations of 680 mg resulted in a mean
maximum reduction of serum IgG levels of 78%, with a standard deviation of 2%. IMVT-1401 was generally well-tolerated in this study, and the majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate. Injection site reactions were similar between
IMVT-1401 and placebo arms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less
frequent, dosing schedule. As a result of our rational design, we believe that IMVT-1401, if approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases, (e.g., myasthenia gravis (&#147;MG&#148;), thyroid eye disease (&#147;TED&#148;, also known as Graves&#146; ophthalmopathy, or &#147;GO&#148;), warm autoimmune hemolytic
anemia (&#147;WAIHA&#148;), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, bullous pemphigoid, neuromyelitis optica, pemphigus foliaceus, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome and PLA2R+
membranous nephropathy). In 2019, these diseases had an aggregate prevalence of approximately 243,000 patients in the United States and 388,000 patients in Europe. To the extent we choose to develop IMVT-1401 for certain of these rare diseases, we
plan to seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. However, we have not yet sought
such designation for any of our three target indications, and there is no certainty that we would obtain such designation, or maintain the benefits associated with such designation, if or when we do. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection, with an initial focus on the treatment
of MG, TED and WAIHA. MG is an autoimmune disease associated with muscle weakness with an estimated prevalence of one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases in the United States. In MG, patients develop pathogenic IgG antibodies that attack critical
signaling proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells. The majority of MG patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness, with maximum weakness occurring within six months of disease onset in most patients. In severe cases, MG patients
can experience myasthenic crisis, in which respiratory function is weakened to the point where it becomes life-threatening, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. In August 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND MG trial, a Phase 2a
clinical trial in patients with MG. We expect to report results from the placebo-controlled treatment phase of this trial in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of calendar year 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TED is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. TED has an estimated
annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and Europe. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the
eyes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-1 trial, a Phase 2a clinical trial in Canada in patients with TED. On March 30, 2020, we
announced initial results from this trial. Mean reduction in total IgG levels from baseline to end of treatment was 65%. As evaluated at the end of treatment, four of seven patients (57%) improved by <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 2
points on the Clinical Activity Score (&#147;CAS&#148;). Clinicians use CAS to measure disease activity in TED patients. CAS is based on seven parameters, including spontaneous pain behind the eye, pain with eye movement, redness of the eyelids,
redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, swelling of the caruncle and swelling of the conjunctiva. A score is calculated based on the number of parameters that are positive with scores of four or above considered to be cases of active
disease. Of six patients with baseline diplopia, four patients (67%) demonstrated improvement in diplopia. Three of seven patients (43%) were proptosis responders. The safety and tolerability profile observed was consistent with the prior Phase 1
trial of IMVT-1401 in 99 healthy volunteers. All AEs were mild or moderate and there were no headaches reported. Enrollment is ongoing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a Phase 2b clinical trial for TED in the United States, Canada and Europe. As previously
communicated, results from this trial are still possible in the first half of calendar year 2021. We intend to provide an update on the timing for this trial in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells (&#147;RBCs&#148;). Based on published
estimates, we believe that there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 66,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness,
skin paleness and shortness of breath. In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body&#146;s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. In November 2019, we submitted our investigational new drug
application (&#147;IND&#148;) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) for WAIHA and, in December 2019, our IND was cleared for Phase 2 trial initiation. As previously communicated, results from this trial are still possible by the
end of second half of calendar year 2020. We intend to provide an update on the timing for this trial in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor is a cellular receptor that can bind IgG antibodies and guide their transport through cells. FcRn is named as
such given its critical role in transferring maternal IgG antibodies contained in breast milk across the gut into the neonate&#146;s bloodstream, providing passive immunity until such time as the child is sufficiently mature to produce its own
antibodies. FcRn is also involved in the transfer of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta in the developing fetus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In adults, FcRn is the primary
protein responsible for preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies and albumin, the most abundant protein found in the blood. IgG antibodies are constantly being removed from circulation and internalized in cellular organelles called endosomes.
The role of FcRn is to bind to the IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome and transport them to the cell surface, where the neutral pH causes them to be released back into circulation. This FcRn mechanism of action and IgG
antibody recycling is depicted in the graphic below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>FcRn and IgG Antibody Recycling </B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidate, IMVT-1401, is designed to block the recycling of IgG antibodies, resulting in their
removal from circulation. IMVT-1401 binds to FcRn, blocking the ability of FcRn to bind to IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome. As a result, the bound IMVT-1401 and FcRn are transported to the cell surface, where FcRn is
prevented from further recycling IgG antibodies as IMVT-1401 remains bound to FcRn even in the pH neutral environment outside the endosome. Meanwhile, the unbound IgG antibodies are degraded in the lysosome rather than being transported by FcRn for
release back into circulation. This IMVT-1401 mechanism of action is depicted in the graphic below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>IMVT-1401&#146;s Mechanism of

and was well-tolerated following subcutaneous and intravenous administration to healthy volunteers. In addition, completed clinical trials of other anti-FcRn antibodies have produced positive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection for a variety of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases,
with an initial focus on the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken several actions designed to protect the safety and well-being of our patients and ensure quality trial execution. Our very experienced
clinical development team has successfully maintained robust communication with our sites. New patients enrolled in our programs from March to June 2020 did not miss any in-person clinic visits during the initial treatment period. We have also been
working with our partners to ensure that backup services are in place, which has enabled some virtual visits to replace in-person visits during the follow-up period after initial treatment. As always, we continue to stay abreast of evolving guidance
from regulatory agencies emphasizing patient safety, flexibility within certain guardrails and very good documentation.&nbsp;While we continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to provide an update on our anticipated
clinical development timelines for TED and WAIHA in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 1 Clinical Trials of IMVT-1401 in Healthy

dose administration. In addition, single subcutaneous doses of IMVT-1401, ranging from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg and 340 mg to 765 mg led to dose-dependent mean maximum reductions in serum IgG levels of between 14% and 48%. Maximal reductions were observed
between seven and 14 days after dose administration. Following four-weekly SC doses of IMVT-1401 at 340 mg and 680 mg, mean maximum reduction of serum IgG levels were 63% and 78%, respectively, compared with 11% for placebo. Maximal reductions were
observed between 21 and 28 days after the first dose of IMVT-1401. </P>

which typically resolved within hours and had a similar incidence between subjects receiving IMVT-1401 and placebo. These reactions at the injection site were not considered dose-related and did not increase with multiple administrations of
IMVT-1401 in the multiple-dose cohorts. To date, two serious AEs have been reported, both of which have been assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. There have been no treatment-related serious AEs reported. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2018, one serious AE (malpighian carcinoma) occurred in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">51-year-old</FONT></FONT> subject who had received a single 765 mg subcutaneous administration of IMVT-1401. Fifty-five days after study drug administration, the subject presented to his personal physician with a
left-sided neck mass. Biopsy results determined the mass to be a poorly differentiated malpighian carcinoma, which was assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. In February 2019, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">25-year-old</FONT></FONT> subject who received a single dose 1530 mg of IMVT-1401 by intravenous infusion presented five days later with uncomplicated acute appendicitis and the presence of an appendiceal stone. The
subject underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and recovered with an uneventful post-operative course. The event was considered unrelated to study drug by the study investigator. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While headaches, some of which have been considered severe, have been reported in third-party clinical trials of some other anti-FcRn antibodies, no headaches
have been noted in any of the subjects receiving IMVT-1401 in the 680 mg multiple-dose cohort. In the 340 mg cohort, two of eight subjects experienced headaches, one mild and one moderate. The moderate headache occurred six days after the final dose
of IMVT-1401 was administered. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dose-dependent and reversible albumin reductions were observed in the single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose
cohorts. In the 680 mg multiple-ascending dose cohort, most subjects reached nadir before administration of the final dose. Mean reduction in albumin levels at day 28 were 20% in the 340 mg multiple-dose cohort, and 31% in the 680 mg multiple-dose
cohort. For subjects in the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts, the mean albumin levels at day 28 were 37.5 g/L and 32.4 g/L, respectively (normal range <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">36-51</FONT> g/L). These reductions were not associated with any AEs or
clinical symptoms and did not lead to any study discontinuations. The clinical relevance of isolated, mild hypoalbuminemia is unknown, however, a hereditary syndrome associated with deficient albumin production has been described (Congenital
Analbumenia). In this syndrome, despite extremely low or absent levels of albumin, those affected have only mild symptoms, including fatigue, low blood pressure and edema. It is believed that compensatory mechanisms through the production of other
proteins may allow for relatively normal physiologic function in this population. </P>

were low (<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT> 1:16) consistent with the high sensitivity of the ADA assay. No subjects in either the 340 mg or 680 mg multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts developed ADAs with treatment. ADAs will continue
to be monitored throughout the development program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Nonclinical Studies of IMVT-1401 </I></B></P>

strong binding affinity for monkey FcRn. Our partner, HanAll, completed five nonclinical studies of IMVT-1401 (referred as HL161BKN for the purposes of these studies) in cynomolgus monkeys. We have conducted two additional studies in cynomolgus

(Study 8348381, Study 8386882, respectively), exposure to IMVT-1401, a fully human monoclonal antibody, resulted in the development of an ADA response that led to immune complex formation in isolated animals. In the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-week</FONT> study, at least one sampling point tested positive for ADA in 37 of the 38 animals that received IMVT-1401 twice weekly by subcutaneous or intravenous administration. Some animals with ADA had reduced
TK and PD responses. However, the majority of animals still had measurable circulating levels of IMVT-1401 that translated to reduced IgG levels. In the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-week</FONT> toxicology study all animals developed ADA by
Day 22 of the treatment phase of the study, and IMVT-1401 exposures on Days 43 and 78 were generally lower compared to Day 1, particularly with low subcutaneous doses. An abrogation of the PD response was observed following development of ADA in the
lower dose cohorts but was maintained in the higher dose cohorts. In the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">26-week</FONT> toxicology study (Study 8391434), animals administered by IV infusion resulted in higher incidence of ADA positive responses
compared to animals dosed by SC injections. Over the course of the study, PD effect of total IgG reductions was observed in all animals. The decrease in total IgG was more pronounced in animals administered with 100 mg/kg/week IV compared to animals
administered 200 mg/kg/week SC. Reversibility of the total IgG reduction in the SC animals was evident by Day 64 in the recovery phase. Importantly from the subchronic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">26-week</FONT> toxicity study, based on the
overall toxicity profile following 26 weeks of SC injections (200 mg/kg/week), the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level</FONT> (NOAEL) of IMVT-1401 following SC injection was concluded to be 100 mg/kg/dose or 200
mg/kg/week; this represents a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">3-fold</FONT> safety margin (100 mg/kg/dose) when compared to the clinical dose of 680 mg/dose taking into account allometric corrections between monkeys and humans. Moreover, the safety
margin is increased to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">6-fold</FONT> when considering IMVT-1401 was administered twice per week at 200 mg/kg/week. Overall, in these nonclinical studies, there was a robust PK/TK and PD correlation in cynomolgus
monkeys after removing the confounding element of ADA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The immunogenicity response to human proteins generated in nonclinical species is generally not

disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of
nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized to exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration.
Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine
receptor (&#147;AChR&#148;) antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The prevalence of MG is estimated to be one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases expected in the United States. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset
tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in individuals between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in individuals over 50 years old and predominantly affects
males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are
genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The symptoms of the disease can be transient
and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often
becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating
long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to
breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of
the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinicians have developed a quantitative examination-based scoring system to follow a patient&#146;s disease severity called
the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (&#147;QMG score&#148;), which measures muscle weakness. The QMG score is divided into 13 sections, each measuring the weakness of different sets of muscles such as that of outstretched limbs, grip strength,
breathing, swallowing, eye movement, speech and neck strength. Each item is assessed on a four-point scale where a score of zero represents no weakness and a score of three represents severe weakness for a maximum total score of 39. Clinicians also
use the MG Activities of Daily Living <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(&#147;MG-ADL&#148;)</FONT> score, a clinically validated, patient-reported measurement of the severity of MG symptoms. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">MG-ADL</FONT> score
measures the effect of MG symptoms on eight functions as reported by the patient, including talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing and vision. Each item is assessed on a three-point scale where a score of zero represents no symptoms and a score of
three represents severe symptoms for a maximum total of 24. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Previously completed clinical trials of anti-FcRn antibodies have generated promising
results. In a recently completed Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by argenx SE to evaluate efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment for the treatment of MG, patients dosed with intravenous drug product demonstrated clinically meaningful and
statistically significant responder rate in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">MG-ADL</FONT> score compared to those receiving placebo after four weeks of treatment. Note that detailed and longer term safety data has not yet been reported. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most common target of autoimmune antibodies in MG are the AChR protein within the neuromuscular junction that binds to the acetylcholine neurotransmitter
released by the nerve fiber terminal, and muscle-specific kinase (&#147;MuSK&#148;), a tyrosine kinase, which is involved in propagating neuronal signals. Anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibodies are found in approximately 85% and 8% of MG patients,
respectively. The presence of these autoimmune antibodies blocks the signaling from neurons to muscles which results in an impaired ability for the muscle to contract or sustain contraction and results in outward signs of muscle weakness and
fatigue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Current Treatment Paradigm </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Very
early stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, which block the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby increasing its concentration and capacity to activate the
muscle. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a
thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple
potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. However, IVIg requires recurrent, burdensome infusions to obtain significant reductions in symptoms, and the large volumes of intravenous fluid associated with the administration of IVIg can
lead to significant side effects, including pulmonary edema and renal complications and treatment can be complicated by events associated with intravascular thrombosis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies.
One method of reducing IgG levels is to take blood from a patient and physically remove the patient&#146;s plasma before returning the red blood cells as well as outside obtained albumin or plasma to the patient in a process called plasma exchange.
This is a slow process that typically takes several hours. Furthermore, this process often requires multiple treatment sequences due to limited daily tolerance (a reported mean of 6 treatments in MG) over a number of days in order to achieve a
significant reduction in IgG antibody levels. A variant of this procedure is immunoadsorption, in which bacterial proteins are used to selectively remove IgG antibodies from serum. The table below sets forth an overview of these treatments for MG.
The most recent agent approved for MG is eculizumab, a complement C5 inhibitor, the use of which is limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Anti-MuSK antibodies have a low propensity to activate complement
proteins, thus C5 inhibition may not be therapeutically relevant in anti-MuSK-positive patients. Studies indicating that patients with MuSK-positive disease are more likely to become treatment refractory thus present an additional unmet need.
Approximately 10% of MG patients are refractory to current treatments, while up to 80% fail to achieve complete stable remission. </P>

dosing in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG. The ASCEND MG trial assesses safety and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in an anticipated 21 patients with MG symptoms, as defined by MGFA Class
II through IVa, and QMG scores greater than or equal to 12. In the ASCEND MG trial, patients with MG who have confirmed anti-AChR antibodies will receive one of two dose levels of IMVT-1401 (680 mg or 340 mg) or placebo delivered by subcutaneous
injection on a weekly schedule for six weeks followed by a six-week open-label extension period, in which patients will be able to receive up to three further injections of IMVT-1401 administered every other week. There are then three follow-up
visits during a six-week post-dosing period. The primary endpoints of this trial are assessment of the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 and measurement of the changes from baseline in levels of total IgG subclasses and anti-AChR IgG. Secondary
endpoints include PK and changes from baseline in various clinical scores such as QMG, MG-ADL and quality of life measures. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers
and receptor occupancy. We expect to report results from the placebo-controlled treatment phase of this trial in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of calendar year 2020. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Thyroid Eye Disease Overview </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TED, also referred to
as GO, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double
vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. By the time that TED is clinically diagnosed, many patients have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes and protrusion of the eyes. In some cases, swelling and
stiffness of the muscles that move the eyes cause the eyes to no longer line up with each other or for the eyelids to no longer be able to close. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease, with intense pain,
inflammation and sight-threatening corneal ulcers or optic neuropathy that requires surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED
patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (&#147;TSHR&#148;). These
antibodies activate certain cell types, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes, present in the extraocular space, which are known to highly express TSHR. The activation of these fibroblasts causes them to proliferate and to produce hyaluronan, a
substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes and extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling.
Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, lead to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms. Anti-TSHR antibodies also increase the proliferation of adipose or fat cells as well as myofibroblasts, smooth
muscle-like cells. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to
anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (&#147;IGF1R&#148;) have been described in the literature. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation
of similar biochemical pathways in certain cell types, including the ones implicated in TED. Published studies investing this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of
TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggest that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be
completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TED has an estimated annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and
Europe. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. Treatment of patients with
immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels
of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States have active inflammatory TED and are eligible for treatment. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinicians use the CAS to measure disease activity in TED patients. CAS is based on seven parameters,
including spontaneous pain behind the eye, pain with eye movement, redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, swelling of the caruncle and swelling of the conjunctiva. A score is calculated based on the number of
parameters that are positive with scores of four or above considered to be cases of active disease. Changes in disease severity over time are determined by changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, eye movements and visual acuity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Relationship between TED and Graves&#146; Disease </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">TED often develops in parallel with Graves&#146; disease, a related but clinically distinct autoimmune disease. In Graves&#146; disease, anti-TSHR
autoantibodies cause the thyroid to become overactive, resulting in a condition called hyperthyroidism, in which the thyroid overproduces thyroid hormone. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles,
menstrual cycle and fertility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A close temporal relationship exists between the onset of Graves&#146; disease and the onset of TED. Regardless of which
condition occurs first, in 80% of patients, the other condition develops within 18 months. Approximately one in 20 patients with Graves&#146; disease present with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> TED, which is characterized by swelling and redness of eyelids, proptosis, double vision and, in severe cases, corneal ulceration and decreased visual
acuity. Graves&#146; disease can be treated with antithyroid drugs or removal of the thyroid through a procedure called a thyroidectomy. While some studies of these treatments have shown autoimmune antibodies decreasing or disappearing with
treatment, others have shown no change in antibody levels after treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Current Treatment Paradigm </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high-doses of corticosteroids, typically administered
intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third</FONT> of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ
damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics&#146; Tepezza (teprotumumab), an
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-IGF-1R</FONT></FONT> antibody, for the treatment of TED. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Orbital radiation therapy
is used as a means of reducing the infiltration of lymphocytes and can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Similar to these anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy is most effective in
the active stage of TED. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> active TED
which is still in the active stage and who do not respond adequately to corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, two broad immunosuppressive drugs. These powerful drugs are associated with numerous side effects
related both to their general immunosuppressive effects as well as to inherent toxicities, such as hypertension, kidney disease and gastrointestinal toxicity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Small case studies have identified rituximab as an alternate way of inducing immunosuppression in patients with TED. Rituximab (Roche) is a monoclonal
antibody that binds to an antigen specific to B cells, leading to their destruction. However, rituximab is associated with the potential for serious side effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Rare cases of progressive multifocal
encephalopathy and other viral infections have also been reported. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Surgery is considered to be a treatment option in patients with a high CAS who have
been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy but continue to have progressive disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the pressure causing proptosis, reduced eye movement and loss of visual acuity. Because of its invasive nature,
surgery is typically reserved for inactive disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that a therapy for TED focused on addressing the cause of the disease, namely the presence
of autoimmune antibodies, represents an attractive approach that has the potential to avoid many of the serious side effects of current therapies. In previously conducted third-party studies, levels of autoimmune antibodies were reduced through
plasmapheresis and IVIg and resulted in therapeutic benefit. We expect that IMVT-1401 has the potential to deliver similar benefits. Because the mode of action of IMVT-1401 is independent of the antigen recognized by the autoimmune antibodies, we
believe that IMVT-1401 can address TED that arises through any IgG autoantibody mechanism whether it be anti-TSHR, anti-IGF1R, or any other IgG autoantibodies. </P>

utilized an induction and maintenance strategy, using only subcutaneous injections. Patients received a 680 mg dose for the first two administrations of study followed by a 340 mg dose for the final four administrations. The primary endpoints of
this trial are safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 over the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-week</FONT> treatment period, as well as the change from baseline in levels of anti-TSHR antibodies, total IgG antibodies and IgG antibodies by
subclasses. Secondary clinical endpoints include mean changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, the proptosis responder rate, defined as the percentage of patients with a greater than or equal to 2 mm reduction in proptosis in the study
eye without deterioration in the fellow eye, PK and anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory endpoints include assessment of change from baseline in the CAS, change from baseline in the Gorman diplopia score, multiple biomarkers including gene expression

a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of RBCs. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-specific</FONT> symptoms of anemia such as
fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically develop chronically over several weeks to months, however rapid progression over a span of days has also been observed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body&#146;s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. Though the
exact causes of WAIHA are unknown, roughly half of cases occur in patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In WAIHA, autoantibodies react with surface proteins on RBCs at temperatures at or above 37&deg; Celsius, or normal body temperature. These antibodies are of
the IgG subtype in the majority of patients. WAIHA is differentiated from cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or cold agglutinin disease, which shares a similar clinical presentation but is triggered by autoantibodies that react at temperatures below
37&deg; Celsius. In WAIHA, antibody-coated RBCs are removed from circulation primarily in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. Studies have suggested the severity of WAIHA correlates with the amount and potency of autoantibodies
present. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The laboratory evaluation of WAIHA begins with a peripheral blood analysis revealing evidence of extravascular hemolysis (spherocytes, low
haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin and elevated LDH). In over 97% of cases, patients have a positive direct antiglobulin test, which detects the presence of IgG or complement proteins bound to the surface of RBCs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The annual incidence of WAIHA in the United States and Europe is estimated at one to three in 100,000 persons. Based on published estimates, we believe that
there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 66,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The disease may be more common in females, with some sources suggesting a 2:1 female predominance. Peak incidence occurs during the sixth
and seventh decades of life, however, WAIHA can occur in children as well. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Current Treatment Paradigm </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">High doses of corticosteroids (&gt;1 mg/kg of prednisone) are typically the first-line treatment option for WAIHA and lead to initial disease control in
approximately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">70-85%</FONT> of cases. Once initial disease control is achieved, doses of steroids are tapered. However, only 33% of patients maintain sustained disease control once steroids are discontinued and, as a
result, the majority of patients will require either long-term steroid treatment or additional therapies. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are few studies to guide which treatment options to use in patients failing corticosteroids. Until
recently, splenectomy had been a common second-line treatment option for patients not responding adequately to corticosteroids. The therapeutic benefit of splenectomy is thought to be twofold: first, it eliminates the major site of RBC destruction
in WAIHA; second, removal of the spleen reduces the total lymphoid tissue capable of producing autoantibodies. However, because of the lack of reliable predictors of the outcome, morbidity and potential operative complications of splenectomy,
rituximab has become the default second-line option despite not being approved for use in WAIHA. In case studies looking at patients with relapsed disease after treatment with steroids, single-agent rituximab led to responses in 65% to 90% of
patients. In such a course of treatment, maximal therapeutic effect is not immediate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients with persistent disease despite use of corticosteroids and
rituximab may be offered a course of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine sirolimus. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">IVIg is
not routinely used alone for the treatment of WAIHA, however, small case series have suggested some evidence for a therapeutic effect in patients suffering from life-threatening complications of the disease. In these reports, IVIg has been given at
high doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/kg per day), and the results have been inconsistent, requiring repeated courses of treatment in at least one case. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RBC transfusions are indicated in patients who require immediate stabilization. Such patients are monitored closely for evidence of a transfusion reaction. In
contrast to other treatment modalities that lead to nonspecific suppression of the immune system, IMVT-1401 may offer a more targeted approach for reducing levels of the causative IgG species responsible for most cases of WAIHA. We believe this
could provide a favorable therapeutic window and avoid the significant side effects associated with less targeted immunosuppression. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>ASCEND WAIHA

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2017, Roivant Sciences GmbH (&#147;RSG&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, entered into the HanAll Agreement. Under the HanAll Agreement, RSG
received (1)&nbsp;the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive</FONT> right to manufacture and (2)&nbsp;the exclusive, royalty-bearing right to develop, import and use the antibody referred to as IMVT-1401 and certain <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-up</FONT> and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, and to commercialize such products, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the E.U., the U.K., Switzerland, the Middle East, North
Africa and Latin America (the &#147;Licensed Territory&#148;) for all human and animal uses, during the term of the agreement. With respect to these licenses, RSG also received the right to grant a sublicense, with prior written notice to HanAll of
such sublicense, to: (1)&nbsp;a third party in any country in the Licensed Territory outside of the United States and E.U.; (2) an affiliate of RSG in any country in the Licensed Territory; and (3)&nbsp;a third party in the United States and E.U.
only after submission of a biologics license application (&#147;BLA&#148;) in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in the E.U. Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG granted to HanAll an exclusive, royalty-free license under
certain RSG patents, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> and other intellectual property controlled by RSG relating to such antibodies and products to develop, manufacture and commercialize such antibodies and products for use outside
of the Licensed Territory. HanAll also reserves the right to conduct discovery or research activities with the IMVT-1401 antibody, and certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-up</FONT> and next-generation antibodies, with or through a contract
research organization or service provider in the Licensed Territory. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2018, we obtained and assumed all rights, title, interest and
obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG, including all rights to IMVT-1401 from RSG in the Licensed Territory, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between RSG and our wholly owned subsidiary, Immunovant Sciences GmbH
(&#147;ISG&#148;), for an aggregate purchase price of $37.8&nbsp;million plus Swiss value-added tax of $2.9&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the HanAll Agreement, the
parties may choose to collaborate on a research program directed to the research and development of next generation FcRn inhibitors in accordance with an agreed plan and budget. We are obligated to reimburse HanAll for half of such research and
development expenses incurred by HanAll, up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0&nbsp;million. Intellectual property created by HanAll pursuant to this research program will be included in our license; intellectual property created by us
pursuant to this research program will be included in HanAll&#146;s license. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG made an upfront payment of
$30.0&nbsp;million to HanAll. In May 2019, we achieved our first development and regulatory milestone, which resulted in a $10.0&nbsp;million milestone payment that we subsequently paid in August 2019. We will be responsible for future contingent
payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5&nbsp;million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-single</FONT> digits to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-teens</FONT> on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement. These royalty obligations
apply on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">product-by-product</FONT></FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">country-by-country</FONT></FONT> basis and end upon the latest of:
(A)&nbsp;the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents expire, (B)&nbsp;the date on which the data or market exclusivity expires or (C) 11 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product, in each case, with respect to
a given product in a given country. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Except for cost-sharing in connection with the research program, we are solely responsible, at our expense, for all
other activities related to the research, development and commercialization of licensed products for the Licensed Territory. We may use a third party for manufacturing activities necessary for the research, development and commercialization of
licensed products for the Licensed Territory. In addition, under the HanAll Agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the Licensed Territory. Each party has agreed that neither
it nor certain of its affiliates will clinically develop or commercialize certain competitive products in the Licensed Territory. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the HanAll
Agreement, we have the sole right, but not the obligation, to control the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the licensed patents in the Licensed Territory, and HanAll has backup rights to prosecution, defense and enforcement with respect to
any licensed patents for which we elect not to exercise such rights. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The HanAll Agreement will expire on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">product-by-product</FONT></FONT> basis on the expiration of the last royalty term with respect to a given licensed product, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the HanAll Agreement in its entirety without cause
upon 180 days&#146; written notice following 30 days of discussion. Either party may terminate the HanAll Agreement upon 60 days&#146; written notice for uncured material breach (or 30 days in the case of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-payment),</FONT> or immediately upon written notice if the other party files a voluntary petition, is subject to a substantiated involuntary petition or for certain other solvency events. HanAll may terminate the
HanAll Agreement if we or our affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Services Agreements with RSI and
RSG </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2018, we entered into services agreements (the &#147;Services Agreements&#148;) with Roivant Sciences Inc. (&#147;RSI&#148;) and
RSG, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to us during our formative period. Under each Services Agreement, we will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as applicable, for any
expenses they, or third parties acting on our behalf, incur. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back the employee compensation expense
plus a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-determined</FONT> markup. RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were
rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements
will continue until terminated by us, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days&#146; written notice. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of IMVT-1401, and there are a limited
number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA&#146;s current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#147;cGMP&#148;) requirements (particularly for the development of antibodies) of the FDA that might be capable of manufacturing for us. We currently
rely and intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturing organizations (&#147;CMOs&#148;), for both drug substance and drug product. Currently, we contract with two well-established third-party manufacturers, one for the manufacture of our drug
substance and another for the manufacture of our drug product. We expect to engage additional third-party manufacturers to support any pivotal clinical trials for IMVT-1401 as well as commercialization of IMVT-1401, if approved, in the United States
or other jurisdictions. In addition, we intend to recruit personnel with experience to manage the CMOs producing our product candidate and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on CMOs to first develop cell lines and manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP then produce
material for nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Our agreements with CMOs may obligate them to develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product
process, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for nonclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance, or produce cGMP-compliant drug
product. We conduct audits of CMOs prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. </P>

other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as IMVT-1401. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These
include efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Momenta Pharmaceuticals), rozanolixizumab (UCB) and ALXN1830 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals). Each of efgartigimod, nipocalimab, and rozanolixizumab is currently under development for the treatment of MG. In
addition, for WAIHA, Alexion has announced plans to begin a Phase 2 trial for ALXN1830 in 2021 and Momenta is conducting an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical study for nipocalimab. Momenta also announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for
nipocalimab in WAIHA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a Phase 1 trial conducted by argenx SE, efgartigimod was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 50% after two 20
mg/kg intravenous induction doses followed by eight weekly 300 mg subcutaneous doses. In a Phase 2 trial conducted in MG, UCB&#146;s rozanolixizumab was infused subcutaneously, over 30 minutes, and was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by
approximately 56% and approximately 68% after three and six weekly 7 mg/kg infusions, respectively. Momenta&#146;s nipocalimab is not yet in clinical development with a subcutaneous formulation and no clinical results for Alexion&#146;s subcutaneous
formulation of ALXN1830 are available. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">IMVT-1401, if approved, may also face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January
2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics&#146; Tepezza (teprotumumab), an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-IGF-1R</FONT></FONT> antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line
agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by Alexion), an
antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for TED and WAIHA patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy,
including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a
monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases. Momenta is developing its
hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan
(UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, currently in a Phase 3 trial in a similar patient population; amifampridine (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals), a neuronal potassium channel blocker, for MG patients positive for the MuSK antibody, which is currently in
Phase 3; and Myasterix (CuraVac), a therapeutic vaccine against B and T cells, which is being tested in early stage trials in MG patients. Moreover, Viela Bio has announced plans to initiate a pivotal trial in MG for inebilizumab, a CD19-targeted
humanized monoclonal antibody, in 2020. Toleranzia has announced its intention to initiate Ph1/2a program in MG patients for its immunomodulating complex, TOL2, in 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Numerous product candidates are currently in development for the treatment of WAIHA. Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in
Phase 3 development. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Kezar Life Sciences is running a Phase 2 trial including WAIHA patients for its immunoproteasome inhibitor, <FONT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our
ability to compete will significantly depend upon its ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that it may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors
include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing
approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, reimbursement and public opinion. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than
we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential
future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries could result in even more resources
being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for
therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for any of our targeted indications by a competitor could render our product candidate <FONT

adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular jurisdiction. Notably, in this patent family, a U.S. patent in the patent family was issued on July&nbsp;2, 2019, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or
antigen&#150;binding fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Furthermore, another U.S. patent was issued in this patent family on January&nbsp;28, 2020, with claims directed to
an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof as well as methods of treating various autoimmune diseases using the antibody,
polynucleotides and expression vectors encoding the antibody, host cells capable of expressing the antibody and methods of producing the antibody. </P>

biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods. A medicinal product that has been designated as an orphan medicinal product must also be evaluated
through the centralized procedure. A medicinal product that is considered as constituting a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or its approval is in the interests of E.U. patients is also eligible for the optional
centralized assessment. The centralized procedure requires applicants to submit an application for marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (&#147;EMA&#148;) which is responsible for the coordinating the scientific assessment to be

time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. The FDA also may impose

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the
supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols
detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial
conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. For new indications, a separate new IND may be required. Outside of the U.S., clinical trial applications are generally required to conduct clinical studies in each
country. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the
study until completed to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at
any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified
experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt
the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study
results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the <I>www.clinicaltrials.gov</I> website. For purposes of BLA/MAA approval, human clinical trials are typically
conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

product is approved to gain more information about the product. These <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or, in certain circumstances, mandated after approval. During all
phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be
submitted to the FDA, and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, other regulators, and investigators within a regulated timeframe for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of
the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product
candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. The FDA may require such testing to occur on a <FONT

development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and
clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other information. The
submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a

<Center><DIV STYLE="width:8.5in" align="left">
 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA reviews the BLA within 60 days to determine if it is substantially
complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted
with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#147;PDUFA&#148;), the
FDA&#146;s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and
priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a
product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to
provide clinical insight on application review questions and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers
such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the
manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or
more clinical sites, preclinical studies, and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the
submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be
produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe
all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, and where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting
required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including
requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance
to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and
may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed, which could limit the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its
risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician
communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the
development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-and</FONT> post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after
the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of
the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Expedited Development and Review Programs </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval
process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A product is eligible for priority review if it
is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation means the FDA&#146;s goal under PDUFA is to take action on the marketing application within
six months of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">60-day</FONT> filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). In addition, if a sponsor submits a BLA for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for
use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat, and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent application or sold to another applicant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or
life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.
Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the
complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The review clock generally
does not begin until the final section of the BLA is submitted. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act
(&#147;FDASIA&#148;) passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#147;breakthrough therapy.&#148; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or
more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more
clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions,
such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful
therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a validated surrogate
endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival,
irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated
effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approval</FONT> of promotional materials, which could
adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later
decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and
accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Orphan Drug
Designation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition,
which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in
the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan
designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review
or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such
designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances,
such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a
different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a
use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if
the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, in
the E.U., the European Commission grants binding decision on orphan designations after a satisfactory scientific assessment provided by the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. To qualify for orphan designation, a medicinal product
must meet the following criteria set out in E.U. Orphan Medicinal Products Regulation: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the orphan designation is maintained when the marketing authorization is granted, then the orphan medicinal product will enjoy <FONT

period can be extended to a total period of 12 years under the E.U. Pediatric Regulation in lieu of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> extension of the supplementary protection certificate. The orphan exclusivity is run in parallel
with the basic regulatory data/market protection or exclusivity period of 10 years in the E.U. However, this period can be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer
met where it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After its departure from the E.U., there will be a U.K. system for regulating medicinal products for treating rare diseases including granting of orphan
status determined by the MHRA as is the case in the current E.U. system. Overall, the orphan criteria would still be based on the current E.U. criteria, but U.K.-specific considerations will be incorporated into the local system. These will be based
on the prevalence of the rare disease in the U.K., the availability of satisfactory alternative treatment methods in the U.K. and the significant benefit of the product. The evaluation of compliance with orphan criteria would be conducted in
parallel with the review of quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine at the time of the marketing authorization application. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where a medicine
receives orphan status the initial marketing authorization (&#147;MA&#148;) application fee will be refunded at 100% for SMEs and 10% for all other manufacturers. For these medicines small medium sized enterprises will also receive a fee waiver for
variations in the first year after the MA is granted. The 10 years market exclusivity from competition from similar products in the approved orphan indication would be retained. If criteria for orphan status are met, this incentive would be awarded
following grant of a U.K. marketing authorization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to the MHRA, the E.U. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-marketing</FONT> authorization
orphan designation will not be replicated in the U.K., given that this will be available at E.U. level and that a separate U.K.-only designation is unlikely to further incentivize industry to warrant the investment required to resource a separate
system. As it has been proposed to have a U.K.-specific criteria for determining whether a drug qualifies as &#145;orphan&#146;, it would not be possible simply to accept the E.U. designation for these high value drugs; however, the government has
committed to monitor these incentives and will consider any further evidence to support this. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Pediatric Information </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (&#147;PREA&#148;), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy
of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for
submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form,
new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (&#147;PSP&#148;), within sixty days of an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-of-Phase</FONT></FONT> 2 meeting or, if there
is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design,
age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from
pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based
on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the E.U., a sponsor is required to
obtain an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (&#147;PIP&#148;) which describes a program of pediatric studies to generate meaningful data to inform the use of the product in the pediatric population. The data derived from the PIP must be submitted
with the marketing authorization application unless a waiver or a deferral is granted. Otherwise, the application will not be accepted by the EMA for review. If the pediatric data required by the PIP are submitted, irrespective of whether the data
have led to approval of a pediatric indication, the orphan exclusivity period is extended to a total period of 12 years. For a product which is not an orphan medicinal product, the supplementary protection certificate can be extended to a further 6
months under the E.U. pediatric rules. For a medicinal product which is no longer protected by a subsisting patent, a pediatric use marketing authorization can be sought and upon approval, a period of 10 years regulatory data exclusivity or
protection is granted. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other
things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most
changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product
identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state
agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the
change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to
use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the
market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved
labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include,
among other things: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and
efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians
may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product&#146;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of
treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer&#146;s communications on the subject of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use of their products. </P>

Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#147;BPCIA&#148;), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or
interchangeable with an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe, but no
interchangeable biologic has been approved in the United States. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive
components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or
studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products
that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to
exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation
of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years
following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed.
During this <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that
applicant&#146;s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as
interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed &#147;interchangeable&#148; by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact,
implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2020 (&#147;FCAA 2020&#148;) became law. Section&nbsp;610, entitled &#147;Actions for Delays of Generic Drugs and Biological Products&#148;, provides generic drug (ANDA and 505(b)(2)) and biosimilar developers with a private right of action to
obtain sufficient quantities of reference product from the brand manufacturer, or a generic or biosimilar manufacturer, necessary for approval of the developers&#146; generic or biosimilar product. If a generic drug or biosimilar developer is
successful in its suit, the defendant manufacturer would be required to provide sufficient quantities of product on commercially-reasonable, market-based terms and may be required to pay the developer&#146;s reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and costs
as well as financial compensation under certain circumstances. The purpose of section 610 is to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar products. We
cannot determine what effect section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on manufacturers that may develop biosimilar or other competing versions of our products once approved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the E.U., a biosimilar product is approved under a different regulatory pathway, recognizing that a biosimilar product does not meet the conditions set out
in the definition of a generic medicinal product owing to in particular differences relating to raw materials or differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal. In view of these
differences, a biosimilar is required to provide the results of appropriate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-clinical</FONT> tests or clinical trials. However, the biosimilar manufacturer is not required to replicate the testing results or trial
data contained in the dossier of the reference biological medicinal product. The regulatory data/market protection or exclusivity period is the same as a conventional medicinal product as discussed above. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to
the FDA, including but not limited to, Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;) or other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for
Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments and regulatory authorities. For example, our
clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party
payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state
and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and transparency, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-commercial</FONT> activities are subject to certain of
these laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in
whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between
therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and, for example, prescribers, purchasers, third party payors, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting
some common activities from the reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are interpreted narrowly by enforcement authorities, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce
prescribing, purchasing or recommending any product payable by the federal health care programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory
exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, where an arrangement does not clearly meet the terms of an applicable exception or safe harbor, the legality of the arrangement
will be evaluated on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis based on prudential factors that authorities, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector
General, utilize to determine whether a particular arrangement poses a risk of fraud and abuse to the federal health care programs (e.g., increasing costs to government payors). Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for
protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, and we cannot rule out the possibility that enforcement authorities, including the Office of Inspector General, could scrutinize our practices in the future. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to
a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil
and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (&#147;FCA&#148;) (discussed below). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal false
claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or &#147;qui tam&#148; actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or
causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record
or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request
or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been, and continue to be, prosecuted under these laws, among other things, for various conduct. For example, enforcement has
pursued manufacturers allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, and also for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of the product for
unapproved, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label,</FONT> and thus generally <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-reimbursable,</FONT> uses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">HIPAA
created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises,
any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying,
concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback
Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes that were added by HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in
order to have committed a violation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may be subject to data privacy, security, and breach notification regulations administered by the federal
government and the states in which we conduct our business. If we were to enter into a &#147;business associate&#148; relationship with a &#147;covered entity&#148; (&#147;covered entities&#148; being group health plans, certain healthcare
providers, and &#147;healthcare clearinghouses&#148;), we would be subject to the HHS regulations related data privacy, security and security breach notification under the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA (Title&nbsp;II,
Subtitle&nbsp;F of HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#147;HITECH&#148;). Those regulations authorize the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, attorneys&#146;
fees and costs. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-empted</FONT>
by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although the HIPAA privacy, security and breach
notification regulations may not necessarily apply to us, a growing body of state privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information may apply
and could create compliance, investigation, and other risks The definition of &#147;personal information&#148; in these laws differs and in some cases can be quite broad. These laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by U.S.
federal laws. To the extent we hold personally identifiable information, we may be at risk of data security breaches, which could require us to notify affected individuals, regulators, media, credit reporting agencies, and others, and might expose
us to regulatory investigations or private claims of negligence or violation of state law standards for adequately protecting personal information. Relevant state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#147;CCPA&#148;), which contains
significant privacy and data security obligations. The CCPA and other state privacy, security, and breach notification laws may impose substantial penalties for violations, as well as incurring costs associated with investigations, compliance, and
private class-action litigation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the &#147;Sunshine Act&#148;) within the Affordable Care Act,
and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions)
report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf

may apply regardless of payor (i.e., are not exclusive to government payors). We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the
relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing

November&nbsp;27, 2013. In addition, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors
who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of
distribution. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements could require significant capital expenditures, increase our operating costs and impose significant administrative burdens. Several states have
enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other
activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing,
and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign

the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which Immunovant receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize
and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement
may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may develop products that, once approved, may be
administered by a physician, and these products also may have difficulty obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement levels based on payor cost sensitivities and the potential application of formulary management controls (e.g., step edits through
alternative therapies). Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products,
therapies and services, in addition to closely evaluating their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult given the potential cost sensitivities often associated with branded drugs and drugs
administered under the supervision of a physician. It is not clear that third party payors will accept the pharmacoeconomic benefits of products that we commercialize, and we also may need to undertake detailed studies of any therapies that we
commercialize in order to demonstrate their pharmacoeconomic benefits, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective for certain patients, including
depending on the nature of the FDA approvals that we may receive. There is no assurance of coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products under either government programs or from commercial payors. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to
provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on
its investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U., governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their
pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed
once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently
available therapies. Other member states allow companies to establish their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are
being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-priced</FONT> markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors
fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will
continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become a close focus
of government and state regulators. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement rates are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less
favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future, which could have a downward pressure on our commercialization efforts. </P>

foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate
post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in
healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by
major legislative initiatives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its enactment, there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act of 2017 (&#147;TCJA&#148;) included a provision that repealed, effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail
to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#147;individual mandate.&#148; On December&nbsp;14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual
mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December&nbsp;18, 2019, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On March&nbsp;2,
2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or
replace the Affordable Care Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included
aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester
reductions will be suspended from May&nbsp;1, 2020 through December&nbsp;31, 2020 due to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other
things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from
three to five years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug
pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under
Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the
Trump administration&#146;s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135&nbsp;billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March&nbsp;10, 2020, the Trump administration sent &#147;principles&#148; for drug pricing to
Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part
D beneficiary monthly <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration previously released a
&#147;Blueprint,&#148; or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize
manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for
Part B drugs beginning January&nbsp;1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS&#146;s policy change that was effective January&nbsp;1, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While some of
these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biologic product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints,
discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower
reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic. Any
reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to
generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may
affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act </I></B></P>

December&nbsp;6, 2018 and formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On
December&nbsp;18, 2019, HSAC completed the Business Combination, pursuant to which HSAC acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ISL, a Bermuda exempted limited company. Subsequent to the acquisition, ISL became a wholly owned subsidiary of HSAC
and we were renamed &#147;Immunovant, Inc.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We maintain our headquarters at 320 West 37th Street, New York, New York 10018 and also conduct business

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Our business involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this
Annual Report, including our combined and consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks
could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and, if so, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If any of such events were to happen, the trading
price of shares of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to Our Business, Financial
Position and Capital Requirements </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our business, operations and clinical development plans and timelines and supply chain could be adversely
affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on the manufacturing, clinical trial and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, including our contract
manufacturers, CROs, shippers and others. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business could be adversely affected by health epidemics wherever we have clinical trial sites or
other business operations. In addition, health epidemics could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs and other third parties upon whom we rely. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a
substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. Many geographic regions have imposed, or in the future
may impose, &#147;shelter-in-place&#148; orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19. Our headquarters is located in New York City, we have business operations in North Carolina, and our contract
manufacturers are located in the United States and in South Korea. At present, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all employees. The effects of the executive order and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity,
disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.
These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are dependent on a worldwide supply chain for products to be used in our clinical trials and, if approved by the regulatory authorities, for
commercialization. Quarantines, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">shelter-in-place</FONT></FONT> and similar government orders, or the expectation that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions could occur, whether
related to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> or other infectious diseases, could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which could
disrupt our supply chain. For example, any manufacturing supply interruption of IMVT-1401, which is currently manufactured at facilities in the United States and in South Korea, or any future product candidates, could adversely affect our ability to
conduct ongoing and future clinical trials of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates. In addition, closures of transportation carriers and modal hubs could materially impact our clinical development and any future commercialization timelines.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our relationships with our suppliers or other vendors are terminated or scaled back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we
may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Switching or adding additional suppliers or vendors involves substantial cost and requires management
time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new supplier or vendor commences work. As a result, delays generally occur, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any future
commercialization timelines. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. See &#147;Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our
clinical trials have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or concerns among patients
about participating in clinical trials during a pandemic and public health measures imposed by the respective national governments of countries in which the clinical sites are located. Some patients may have difficulty following certain aspects of
clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our inability to successfully recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have
heightened exposure to COVID-19 or experience additional restrictions by their institutions, city, or state governments could adversely impact our clinical trial operations. We continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical
development timelines previously provided. We will provide an update on our clinical development timelines in the third quarter of calendar year 2020 once we have more information about how the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. </P>

increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital and increases economic uncertainty. The trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have, at times, been highly volatile as a result of COVID-19. To the

expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or fail to become commercially viable. We have never generated any product revenue, and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future
losses. We do not currently have any products that are available for commercial sale and we may never generate product revenue or achieve profitability. Our net loss was $66.4&nbsp;million and $28.6&nbsp;million for the fiscal years ended
March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $91.2&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to continue to
incur substantial and increasing losses through the commercialization of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved. We currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale. As a result, we are uncertain when or if we will
achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, obtain
necessary regulatory approvals for such product candidate, and manufacture and successfully commercialize such product candidate alone or in collaboration with others. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully
commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. If we do successfully obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our revenue will be dependent upon, in part and among other things, the size of the markets in the territories
for which we gain regulatory approval, the number of competitors in such markets, the accepted price for our product candidate, the reimbursement environment for our product candidate and whether we own the commercial rights for those territories.
If the indication approved by regulatory authorities for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate
significant revenue from sales of such product candidate, even if approved. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to become and remain profitable may

subsidiary, IMVT Corporation, had 42 employees, including 25 who are engaged in research and development activities. We rely on the administrative support, business development, clinical development and other services provided by RSI and RSG, wholly
owned subsidiaries of RSL, which provide services to us pursuant to the Services Agreements, as further described under the section titled &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions&#151;Affiliate Services Agreements.&#148; For
example, we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on RSI to support our nonclinical and clinical development programs. Personnel and support staff that provide services to us under the Services Agreements are not required to, and we do not
expect that they will, have the management and administration of our business as their primary responsibility, or act exclusively for us. RSI and RSG have limited finance, accounting, clinical development and other resources. Furthermore, RSI and
RSG engage in other business activities and provide support for other of our affiliates and subsidiaries of RSL. If their focus is diverted or their limited resources are otherwise employed, we could face potential delays or disruptions in the
conduct of our ongoing clinical trial programs and the commercialization of our product candidate, if approved, which could harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the
event of a default under or termination of the Services Agreements, we may be unable to contract with substitute service providers on similar terms, in a timely fashion, or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial.
In addition, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of services due to a lack of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> knowledge or synergies. Any termination of our relationship with RSI or RSG, or
decrease in provision of services by RSI and RSG, and any delay in appointing or finding a suitable replacement provider, if one exists, could make it difficult for us to operate our business and continue the clinical development and potential
commercialization of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract

the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will
significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our senior management team and key employees. Our senior management and key employees may terminate
their positions with us at any time. If we lose one or more members of our senior management team or key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies could be adversely affected. Replacing these individuals may be
difficult, cause disruption and may take an extended period of time due to the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, manufacture, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize
products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate additional key personnel. We do not maintain &#147;key person&#148; insurance for any members of our senior
management team or other employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may have difficulties identifying, hiring and integrating new personnel. Future growth would impose
significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount
of its attention away from our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">day-to-day</FONT></FONT> activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively
manage the expansion of our operations across our entities, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining
employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidate. If our management is unable to effectively
manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or grow revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize
IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate and compete effectively will partly depend on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of the
other pharmaceutical companies we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer operating history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more
diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these opportunities may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality
personnel and consultants, the rate and success at which we can develop product candidates and our business will be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our or our

risk that our or our affiliates&#146; employees and contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by
these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA or other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true,
complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing and the GCP or cGMP standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of
financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, bribery, corruption, antitrust violations and
other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other
business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our nonclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal
misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent
this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. Additionally,
we are subject to the risk that a person, including any person who may have engaged in any fraud or misconduct, or government agency could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. Furthermore, we rely on our CROs and clinical
trial sites to adequately report data from our ongoing clinical trials. For example, any failure by such parties to adequately report safety signals to us in a timely manner from any such trials may also affect the approvability of our product
candidate or cause delays and disruptions for the approval of our product candidate, if at all. If our or our affiliates&#146; employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers or
other vendors are alleged or found to be in violation of any such regulatory standards or requirements, or become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement and curtailment of our operations, it could have a significant impact
on our business and financial results, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, suspension or delay in our clinical trials, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare,
Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and additional reporting requirements and oversight, any of which could adversely affect our

the U.K. and E.U., the U.K. will be subject to a transition period until December&nbsp;31, 2020 (the &#147;Transition Period&#148;) during which E.U. rules will continue to apply to the U.K. Pharmaceutical companies can continue to carry out
activities in the U.K. until the end of the Transition Period. However, the U.K. no longer participates in EU institutions after the Transition Period. EMA&#146;s public statement indicates that as of February&nbsp;1, 2020, no U.K. representative
will be appointed or nominated to participate in any EMA scientific committee meeting, working party meeting or the EMA&#146;s management board. Negotiations between the U.K. and the E.U. are expected to continue in relation to the customs and

withdrawal from the E.U. is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K. access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the E.U., or single market, and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will

territories more difficult. There may continue to be economic uncertainty surrounding the consequences of Brexit, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock. </P>

and law and accounting firms, may sustain damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, data breaches, phishing attacks, cybercriminals, natural disasters (including hurricanes and earthquakes), terrorism, war and telecommunication and
electrical failures. We rely on our third-party providers to implement effective security measures and identify and correct for any such failures, deficiencies or breaches. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through
cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of nonclinical or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned
trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or
applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidate or any future product candidate that we may develop could be delayed. </P>

against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, we intend to acquire insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability
insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely

events that may otherwise affect the FDA&#146;s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and
development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and biologics or modifications to approved drugs and
biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December&nbsp;22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidate is still in clinical development and will require extensive clinical testing before we are prepared to submit a BLA or other similar
application for regulatory approval. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will submit a BLA for regulatory approval for our product candidate within our projected timeframes or whether any such application will be approved by the relevant
regulatory authorities. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not agree with our
proposed analysis plans or trial design for any clinical trials for IMVT-1401, including our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO and ASCEND WAIHA trials; and during any such review, may identify unexpected efficacy or safety concerns, which may delay the approval
of an BLA or similar application. The FDA may also find that the benefits of IMVT-1401 in any of our target indications do not outweigh its risks in a manner sufficient to grant regulatory approval. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming

encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. In addition, results from clinical trials may require further evaluation, delaying the next stage of clinical development or submission of a BLA. Further, product candidates in
later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials, and such product candidates may exhibit negative safety signals in later stage
clinical trials that they did not exhibit in nonclinical or earlier-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in, or the discontinuation of, advanced clinical trials due to lack
of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Likewise, the results of early nonclinical studies and clinical trials of IMVT-1401, some of which were not conducted by us, may not be predictive of the
results of our planned development programs, and there can be no assurance that the results of studies conducted by collaborators or other third parties will be viewed favorably or are indicative of our own future trial results. </P>

conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Further, we, the FDA or another regulatory authority may suspend our clinical trials in an entire country at any time, or an IRB may suspend its clinical trial sites within any
country, if it appears that we or our collaborators are failing to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including GCP, that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks, or if the FDA or other regulatory
authority, as the case may be, finds deficiencies in our IND or equivalent applications for other countries or the manner in which the clinical trials are conducted. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement and
completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidate could be harmed, and
our ability to generate product revenue from our product candidate, if approved, may be delayed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, cause a decline in our share price, slow down the approval process, and
jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a termination or suspension
of, or delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidate. We may make formulation or manufacturing changes to our product candidate, in which case we may
need to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical studies to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions. Any delays to our clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we may have the exclusive right
to commercialize our product candidate and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidate could be significantly reduced. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in
connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may conclude that a financial relationship
between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected the integrity of the study. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical
trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead
to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we had no involvement with or control over the nonclinical or clinical

of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior nonclinical testing and clinical trials. In particular, we cannot assure you that the reductions in IgG antibodies that we have observed to date in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IMVT-1401,
which did not include pre-specified endpoints for IgG reduction, will be observed in any future clinical trials. Likewise, promising results in interim analyses or other preliminary analyses do not ensure that the clinical trial as a whole will be
successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier nonclinical studies or clinical trials. These
setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported AEs. The results of nonclinical studies and
early clinical trials of our product candidate may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having
progressed through nonclinical and initial clinical trials. A future failure of a clinical trial to meet its pre-specified endpoints would likely cause us to abandon our product candidate. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will
delay the submission of a BLA to the FDA or other similar applications with other relevant foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidate, if approved, and generate product revenue. Even if our
clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our claims for differentiation or the effectiveness or safety of our product candidate. The FDA has substantial discretion in the review and approval
process and may disagree that our data support the differentiated claims we propose. In addition, only a small percentage of biologics under development result in the submission of a BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.

slower than we anticipate, leading to delays in our development timelines. For example, we may face difficulty enrolling or maintaining a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials for MG, TED and WAIHA due to the existing alternative
treatments available for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA, as patients may decline to enroll or decide to withdraw from our clinical trials due to the risk of receiving placebo. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol,
our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience, delays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, or other factors, related to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19,</FONT> the
existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the

impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials we are conducting. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their drug candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Also,
marketing authorization of competitors in this same class of drugs may impair our ability to enroll patients into our clinical trials, delaying or potentially preventing us from completing recruitment of one or more of our trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our

our product candidate, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies or drugs that become available in the future for the treatment of our target indications. If approved, our product candidate may also compete with unregulated,
unapproved and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> treatments. Even if a biosimilar product is less effective than our product candidate, a less effective biosimilar may be more quickly adopted by physicians and patients than our
competing product candidate based upon cost or convenience. Our product candidate, if approved, is expected to present a novel therapeutic approach for MG, TED and WAIHA and other targeted indications and will have to compete with existing
therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our product, if approved, provide an attractive
alternative to existing and other new therapies to gain a share of some patients&#146; discretionary budgets and to gain physicians&#146; attention within their clinical practices. Some of the companies that may offer competing products also have a
broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including
multiple agents which are in the same class as IMVT-1401. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include, efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab, (Momenta Pharmaceuticals), rozanolixizumab (UCB) and ALXN1830
(Alexion Pharmaceuticals). Each of efgartigimod, nipocalimab, rozanolixizumab and ALXN1830 is currently under development for the treatment of MG. In addition, for WAIHA, Alexion has announced plans to begin a Phase 2 trial for ALXN1830 in early
2020 and Momenta has announced the launch of an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical study for nipocalimab. Momenta also announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for nipocalimab in WAIHA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also expect to face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics&#146; Tepezza
(teprotumumab), an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-IGF-1R</FONT></FONT> antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was
recently approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for patients with TED or WAIHA is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of
corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to
an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases. Momenta is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety
of autoimmune indications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5,
currently in a Phase 3 trial in a similar patient population; amifampridine (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals), a neuronal potassium channel blocker, for MG patients with the MuSK form of the disease, which is currently in Phase 3; and Myasterix (CuraVac),
a therapeutic vaccine against B and T cells, which is being tested in early stage trials in MG patients. Moreover, Viela Bio has announced plans to initiate a pivotal trial in MG for inebilizumab, a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, in
2020. Toleranzia has announced its intention to initiate Ph1/2a program in MG patients for its immunomodulating complex, TOL2, in 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Numerous product
candidates are currently in development for the treatment of WAIHA. Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 development. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in
steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Kezar Life Sciences is running a Phase 2 trial including WAIHA patients for its immunoproteasome inhibitor, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">KZR-616.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater
experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Many of our current and potential future competitors also have
significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of
our competitors. Competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us to participate in clinical trials, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by
one of our competitors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available
for use to treat autoimmune diseases in those international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the
effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market their products. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States. </P>

comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for, and thus commercialize any product candidate, could
negatively impact our ability to generate any revenue from product sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not received approval from regulatory authorities to market any product

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The time required to obtain approval of a BLA by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States is unpredictable but typically takes
many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authority. Prior to submitting a BLA to the FDA or any comparable application to any other foreign
regulatory authorities for approval of any product candidate, we will need to complete pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate favorable results with respect to safety, tolerability and efficacy. In addition, approval policies, regulations,
or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate&#146;s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Securing marketing approvals requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each
therapeutic indication to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidate for the specified indications. We expect to rely on third-party CROs, consultants, our collaborators and personnel from RSI and RSG to assist us in filing and
supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory
authorities. Errors in the submission of applications for marketing approval or issues, including those related to gathering the appropriate data and the inspection process, may ultimately delay or affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval,
commercialize our product candidate and generate product revenue. </P>

creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against these therapeutic proteins, preventing or limiting regulatory approval or our ability to commercialize IMVT-1401. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidate, IMVT-1401, the administration of proteins such as
monoclonal antibodies, even those that are fully human in nature including our product candidate, can cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. These anti-drug antibodies can have no effect or
can neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. Whether anti-drug antibodies will be created and how they react can often not be predicted from nonclinical or even clinical
studies, and their detection or appearance is often delayed. As a result, neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date or upon longer exposure of patients with our product candidates, such as following more chronic administration in
longer lasting clinical trials. In some cases, detection of such neutralizing antibodies can even occur after pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Therefore, there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be detected in
future clinical trials or at a later date upon longer exposure (including after commercialization). If anti-drug antibodies reduce or neutralize the effectiveness of our product candidate, the continued clinical development or receipt of marketing
approval for our product candidate could be delayed or prevented and, even if our product candidate is approved, its commercial success could be limited, any of which would impair our ability to generate revenue and continue operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and even if we
obtain approval for a product candidate in one country or jurisdiction, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize it in any other jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in any jurisdiction, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from
well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be
interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for a product candidate are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In order to market any
products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">country-by-country</FONT></FONT> basis regarding safety
and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other country or jurisdiction outside the United States. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities
in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation, as well as additional
administrative review periods. Seeking regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely
from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets, and we do not have experience in
obtaining regulatory approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be
reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain regulatory approval

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, including for the manufacturing
processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, recordkeeping, conduct of potential post-market studies and post-market submission requirements, export, import, advertising and promotional activities
for such product, among other things, by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment of registration and drug listing requirements,
continued compliance with cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of drug product samples to physicians,
recordkeeping and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be
marketed or to the conditions of approval or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions, including in some cases, a boxed warning be included in the product labeling, which could limit sales
of the product. Regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Regulatory
authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement
action for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States and other comparable regulations in foreign jurisdictions relating to the promotion of prescription
drugs may lead to enforcement actions and investigations by the FDA, DOJ, State Attorneys General and other foreign regulatory agencies alleging violations of United States federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state

plan to seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401, but we may be unable to obtain such designation or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, even if that designation is granted. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to seek orphan drug designation from the FDA for IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA and potentially in other orphan indications in which
there is a medically plausible basis for its use, and we may seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 in the E.U. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition,
defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales
in the United States. In the E.U., the European Medicine Agency&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products assesses orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a
life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the E.U. or a serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the E.U. would be sufficient to
justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product, and where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those
affected by the condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding
towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">user-fee</FONT> waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the
FDA. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation from the FDA subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug
exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan
drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similarly, the FDA can subsequently approve
a drug with the same active moiety for the same condition during the exclusivity period if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, meaning the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care.
In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval in respect of the approved therapeutic
indication if the designation is maintained at the time of granting the EU product approval. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> market exclusivity can be extended to 12 years under the E.U. pediatric regulation if the studies
contained in an agreed pediatric investigation plan are completed with the data submitted for regulatory review as part of the compliance check. This period of exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no
longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. </P>

system for regulating medicinal products for rare diseases by granting orphan designations by MHRA as is the case in the current E.U. system. Overall, the orphan criteria would still be based on the current E.U. criteria, but U.K.-specific
considerations will be incorporated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we intend to seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 from the FDA, we may never receive such
designation. Moreover, obtaining orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, TED or WAIHA does not mean we will be able to obtain such designation for any other indications. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug designation for
IMVT-1401 from the FDA, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, and thus approval of IMVT-1401 could be blocked for seven
years if another company obtains approval and orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug and same condition before us. If we do obtain exclusive marketing rights in the United States, they may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader
than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of the relevant
patients. Further, exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, the same drugs can be approved for different indications and might
then be used <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> in our approved indication, and different drugs for the same condition may already be approved and commercially available. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been, and continue to be, several executive, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could
prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the
United States there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, boosting pricing transparency, improving quality and/or expanding access and the pharmaceutical industry has
been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and related legislation (collectively, the &#147;Affordable Care Act&#148;) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers,
and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things: (1)&nbsp;introduced a new &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; calculation for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused,
instilled, implanted or injected and that are not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (2)&nbsp;increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded rebate liability
from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">fee-for-service</FONT></FONT> Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; (3)&nbsp;established a branded prescription drug fee
that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (4)&nbsp;expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program;
(5)&nbsp;established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers currently must agree to offer 70% <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">point-of-sale</FONT></FONT> discounts off negotiated
prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (6)&nbsp;expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid
programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#146; Medicaid
rebate liability; (7)&nbsp;created a licensure framework for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</FONT> biologic products; and (8)&nbsp;established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There remain judicial and Congressional
challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the TCJA was enacted, which included a provision that repealed,
effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year
that is commonly referred to as the &#147;individual mandate.&#148; On December&nbsp;14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable
Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December&nbsp;18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate
was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On March&nbsp;2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of
certiorari to review the case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act. We are continuing to monitor any
changes to the Affordable Care Act that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other legislative changes have been proposed and
adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain
in effect through 2029, unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May&nbsp;1, 2020 through December&nbsp;31, 2020 due to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic.
In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and
increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely
affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations. Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for
their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription
drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration&#146;s budget proposal for
fiscal year 2021 includes a $135&nbsp;billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> drug
costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March&nbsp;10, 2020, the Trump administration sent &#147;principles&#148; for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other
things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare </P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">out-of-pocket</FONT></FONT> expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration previously released a &#147;Blueprint,&#148; or plan, to
lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of
their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final
rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January&nbsp;1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS&#146;s policy change that was effective January&nbsp;1, 2019. While some of these and other measures
may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual
states in the United States are increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions
on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower
reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic. Any
reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being
able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once marketing approval is obtained. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Coverage and adequate reimbursement
may not be available for our product candidate, which could make it difficult for us to sell it profitably, if approved. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market acceptance and
sales of any approved product that we develop will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health
administration authorities and private health insurers. There is no assurance that our product candidate, if approved, would achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement levels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which drugs they
will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and
amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop through approval will be made on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">plan-by-plan</FONT></FONT> basis. One payor&#146;s determination
to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. Additionally, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an
adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the drug, on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed and whether to
require step therapy. The position of a drug on a formulary generally determines the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-payment</FONT> that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients
and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our
products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors.
Such updates could impact the demand for our products, to the extent that patients who are prescribed our products, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a
product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Even if we do obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and
increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, products. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies
provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for
particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may
impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any
product candidates that we develop. Additionally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any
future drugs profitably. There can be no assurance that our product candidate, if approved, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of
reimbursement will be available, or that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product candidate profitably, if approved for
sale. </P>

product manufacturing, storage and distribution or testing. Third-party vendors may be difficult to identify for our product candidate process and formulation development and manufacturing due to special capabilities required, and they may not be
able to meet our quality standards. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, or in placebo controls for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could
considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has
been obtained for any product candidate, the commercial launch of such product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, due to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> or otherwise, which would impair our ability to
generate revenue from the sale of such product candidate. In addition, IMVT-1401 is a biologic and requires processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Accordingly, multiple steps are needed to
control the manufacturing processes. Problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process or from the materials used in the manufacturing process, which may not be detectable by us in a timely manner, could lead
to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient inventory. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such
changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the BPCIA created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-licensed</FONT> reference biological product. New biologics, such as IMVT-1401, may be entitled to regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA. The BPCIA grants new biologics 12 years of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-granted</FONT> exclusivity. Further, under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by
the FDA. During the period of exclusivity, however, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor&#146;s own nonclinical and data from
adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, the FDA can approve a biosimilar product through an abbreviated approval process. The law is
complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our product candidate, as a biological product, should qualify for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period of exclusivity.
However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidate to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the
opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once
approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biological</FONT> products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of
marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, while we cannot determine what effect section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on
manufacturers that may develop biosimilar or other competing versions of our products once approved, it may ultimately facilitate their entry to the market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection
obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely, and will continue to rely, upon a
combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors and other third parties to protect the intellectual property related to our brand, current and future
drug development programs and product candidate. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates. We seek
to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our current and future drug development programs and product candidates, successfully defending our intellectual property rights against
third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent third-party infringement. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or
desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our
research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations or products and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the
laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope and, in any event, any patent protection we obtain may be limited. We generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend
to make, have made, use, offer for sale, or sell products and where we assess the risk of infringement to justify the cost of seeking patent protection. However, we do not seek protection in all countries where we intend to sell products and we may
not accurately predict all the countries where patent protection would ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. We may also make
statements to regulatory agencies during the regulatory approval process that may be inconsistent with positions that have been taken during prosecution of our patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held
unenforceable. </P>

which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application or be used to invalidate an issued patent. The examination process may require us to narrow our claims, which may limit the scope of any patent protection we obtain. Even if
patents do successfully issue based on our patent applications, and even if such patents cover our product candidate, uses of our product candidate or other aspects related to our product candidate, third parties may challenge their validity,
ownership, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing
similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our product candidate, if approved, and technologies. Other companies may also design around our patents. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent
us from marketing our product candidate, if approved, or practicing our own patented technology. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate while under patent
protection could be reduced. If any of our patents expire or are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise limited by third parties prior to the commercialization of our product candidate, and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to
other enforceable patents protecting our product candidate, competitors and other third parties could market products that are substantially similar to ours and our business would suffer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the patent applications we hold or have <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-licensed</FONT> with respect to our development programs and product candidates
fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidate, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop our product candidate, and
threaten our ability to commercialize future drugs. Any such outcome could have an adverse effect on our business. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless
and until a patent issues from such applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain,
involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the &#147;USPTO&#148;) and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents
are not always applied predictably or uniformly. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and
defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patent reform legislation in the United States could increase those uncertainties and costs surrounding
the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy Smith America Invents Act (the &#147;Leahy-Smith Act&#148;) was signed into law in 2011 and includes a number of significant
changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include
allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and
derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application
will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Publications of
discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not until a patent issue.
Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a
result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect IMVT-1401 or any future product
candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of
our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-issuance</FONT> submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our owned or
licensed patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates and
compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and
patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and
our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices, both in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole
or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our products. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if
all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-provisional</FONT> filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add
additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory
review. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of
time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent
portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The validity,
scope and enforceability of any patents that cover a biologic subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as IMVT-1401, can be challenged by third parties. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For biologics subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as IMVT-1401, the BPCIA provides a mechanism for one or more third parties to seek FDA approval to
manufacture or sell a biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products. Due to the large size and complexity of biological products, as compared to small molecules, a biosimilar must be &#147;highly similar&#148; to the
reference product with &#147;no clinically meaningful differences between the two.&#148; The BPCIA does not require reference product sponsors to list patents in an Orange Book and does not include an automatic
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay of FDA approval upon the timely filing of a lawsuit. The BPCIA, however, does require a formal <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-litigation</FONT> process which includes the exchange of
information between a biosimilar applicant and a reference biologic sponsor that includes the identification of relevant patents and each parties&#146; basis for infringement and invalidity. After the exchange of this information, we may then
initiate a lawsuit within 30 days to defend the patents identified in the exchange. If the biosimilar applicant successfully challenges the asserted patent claims it could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the
relevant patent claims or result in a finding of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement.</FONT> Such litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive
and time-consuming, may divert our management&#146;s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing with IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidate in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and even in
countries where we have sought protection for our intellectual property, such protection may be less extensive than that provided in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing
countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect patent rights to the same extent as federal laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to
prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may exploit our
inventions in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that
in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we may obtain patent rights,
proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at
risk of not issuing. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology
products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or
not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not
issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a
competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products and services that are the same as or similar to our products and services, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many countries, including E.U. countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant
licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our
potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>

adequate amount of time. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of
a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-provisional</FONT> filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in
issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords,
is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidate are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. The patent family directed to the composition of
matter of IMVT-1401 has a natural projected expiration date in 2035 in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting
such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or
identical to ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are not able to obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries
under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify, our business may be harmed. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights in the United States and other
countries with respect to our proprietary technology, product candidate and our target indications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our product
candidate might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify, one of the U.S.
patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product
as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA premarket regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only claims covering
such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries, including the E.U., upon regulatory approval of our product candidates,
based on similar legislation. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review
process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection
during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we are unable to obtain patent term extension, or the
term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner, and our revenue could
be reduced, possibly materially. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering
IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension, or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a shorter period than we had sought. Further, for patents we may later <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license</FONT> or jointly own, we may not have the right to control patent prosecution, including filing with the USPTO a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of these patents was
eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we might not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension would be filed, or obtained, from the USPTO. </P>

commercialization, funding, milestone payment, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an
unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and HanAll, as the licensor, may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed

increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes
over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product

agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the
patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of
the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely
file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-payment</FONT> of fees and failure to
properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidate, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than anticipated, which would have

necessary to the development of our product candidate. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, in which case we would be required to
obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Such a license may not be available, or it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Our business would be harmed if we are not able to obtain such a license on

seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights, may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidate. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to operate while avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of
third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. There is a
substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences,
derivation and administrative law proceedings, inter partes review and post-grant review before the USPTO, as well as oppositions and similar processes in foreign jurisdictions. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which
have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise
interfere with our ability to make, use and sell, if approved, our product candidate. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our
collaborators are developing a product candidate. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product
candidate or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are infringing their patents or employing their proprietary technology
without authorization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods
for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidate. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidate
may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing
process of our product candidate, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a
license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent was to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including
combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the
extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> and inventions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which
could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidate. Defending these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee
resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or
more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would
be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidate. We may fail to obtain any
of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidate, which could harm our business significantly. Claims that we have misappropriated
the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our competitors may be able
to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity,
adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, or prohibit us from manufacturing, importing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates. Any uncertainties resulting from the
initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our
confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a material
adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of these
events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows. </P>

in the United States and elsewhere are not published until approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. In addition, U.S. patent
applications filed before November&nbsp;29, 2000 and certain U.S. patent applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Therefore, patent applications covering our product
candidate or any future product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover
our product candidate or any future product candidates, the use thereof, provided such pending patent applications result in issued patents, our ability to develop and market our product candidate or any future product candidates can be adversely
affected in jurisdictions where such patents issue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in
a patent and the patent&#146;s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidate, if approved. We may
incorrectly determine that our product candidate is not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party&#146;s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of
any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, and our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidate or any future
product candidates, if approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents, we may be subject to infringement claims. We cannot
guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any
of our products that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign products so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could
require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may become
involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or
unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may
refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. The standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can
change, particularly as new technologies develop. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. Further, even if we prevail
against an infringer in U.S. district court, there is always the risk that the infringer will file an appeal and the district court judgment will be overturned at the appeals court and/or that an adverse decision will be issued by the appeals court
relating to the validity or enforceability of our patents. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in a manner insufficient to achieve our
business objectives, or could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid
or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements,
including lack of novelty, obviousness, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-enablement</FONT> or lack of written description or statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with
prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as
ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar </P>

proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is
unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For patents and patent applications that we may <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license,</FONT> we
may have a limited right or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and
perhaps all, of any future patent protection on IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
may not be able to detect or prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be
harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial
costs and distract our management and other employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further
infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that
some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts
or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because the patents

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any patents that we own are assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, ISG. If a third party is found to be infringing such patents, we may not be able to
permanently enjoin the third party from making, using, offering for sale or selling the infringing product or activity for the remaining life of such patent in the United States or foreign jurisdictions because the patent is assigned to our wholly
owned subsidiary, ISG, which is not the entity that would be commercializing a potentially competitive product or service. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because of the expense

expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our issued patent, any patents that may be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the
risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the
situation or initiate or seek some other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-litigious</FONT> action or solution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Changes in United States patent
law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidate. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents relating to our product
candidate, IMVT-1401, and any future product candidates. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in
either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or USPTO rules and regulations could increase the uncertainties and costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the United States federal government retains certain rights in inventions produced with its financial assistance under the Bayh-Dole Act. The
federal government retains a &#147;nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-up</FONT> license&#148; for its own benefit. The Bayh-Dole Act also provides federal agencies with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;march-in</FONT> rights.&#148; <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">March-in</FONT> rights allow the government, in specified circumstances, to require the contractor or successors in title to the patent to grant a
&#147;nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license&#148; to a &#147;responsible applicant or applicants.&#148; If the patent owner refuses to do so, the government may grant the license itself. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances
or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">law-making</FONT> bodies in other countries, the laws and
regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the
governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the
future. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to seeking patents for our product candidate, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how,</FONT>
technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting
agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. Despite these efforts and the contractual provisions employed when
working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information due to our reliance on third parties, increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the
technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third-party consultants and
vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical trials or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to
duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of
our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim
that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect
trade secrets. Further, our key employees, consultants, suppliers or other individuals with access to our proprietary technology and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> may incorporate that technology and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> into projects and inventions developed independently or with third parties. As a result, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of the proprietary rights to such technology or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how,</FONT> and any such dispute may not be resolved in our favor. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those
to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets or other proprietary information were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position
would be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may be subject to claims that our licensors, employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have wrongfully used or

at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our licensors, competitors or potential competitors. Although we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our
employees, consultants, collaborators, independent contractors and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us and to not use the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> or confidential information of their former employer or other third parties, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, collaborators or independent contractors have
inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> or confidential information of their former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no
guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could result in customers seeking other
sources for the technology, or in ceasing from doing business with us. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or product
candidate. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. Moreover, any such
litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to form strategic alliances or sublicense our rights to collaborators, engage with scientific advisors or hire employees or consultants, each of which would have an

or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for
development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs
of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual

which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties may have used trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in certain jurisdictions and may have filed
or may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are
successfully challenged, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries and could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to
advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. If we attempt to enforce our trademarks and assert trademark infringement claims, a court may
determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of
such trademarks. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. </P>

June&nbsp;29, 2020, RSL beneficially owned approximately 57.7% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, we are controlled by RSL and RSL has the ability to substantially influence us and exert significant control
through this ownership position. For example, RSL may be able to control elections of directors, the issuance of equity, including to our employees under equity incentive plans, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger,
amalgamation, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. RSL&#146;s interests may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other stockholders, and it may exercise its voting and other rights in a manner with
which you may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Further, RSL is a privately held company whose ownership and governance structure is not transparent to our other stockholders. There may be changes to the
management or ownership of RSL, or to RSL&#146;s business model, that could impact RSL&#146;s interests in a way that may not coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other stockholders. Any such changes may diminish, or eliminate
entirely, any benefits we expect to derive from our membership in the Roivant family of companies. So long as RSL continues to own a significant amount of our equity, it will continue to be able to strongly influence and effectively control our
decisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>RSL has the right to elect a certain number of directors to our board of directors. </I></B></P>

of incorporation. While the directors appointed by RSL are obligated to act in accordance with their applicable fiduciary duties, they may have equity or other interests in RSL and, accordingly, their interests may be aligned with RSL&#146;s
interests, which may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders. Until such time as Roivant holds less than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between us and minority
holders of shares of our common stock, on the one hand, and RSL, on the other hand. Certain of our directors and employees have equity interests in RSL and, accordingly, their interests may be aligned with RSL&#146;s interests, which may not always
coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders. Further, our other stockholders may not have visibility into the RSL ownership of any of our directors or officers, which may change at any time through acquisition,
disposition, dilution, or otherwise. Any change in our directors&#146; or officers&#146; RSL ownership could impact the interests of those holders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, we are party to certain related party agreements with RSL, RSI and RSG. These entities and their stockholders, including certain of our directors and employees, may have interests which differ from our interests or those of the minority
holders of shares of our common stock. Any material transaction between us and RSL, RSI, RSG or any other affiliate of RSL is subject to our related party transaction policy, which requires prior approval of such transaction by our audit committee.
To the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interests, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. </P>

analysts who cover us downgrade shares of our common stock or change their opinion of shares of our common stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we will incur significant legal, accounting and other
expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;Sarbanes Oxley Act&#148;), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable
securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will
increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities
may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors&#146; and officers&#146;
liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs
we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>As a result of becoming a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain
proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of shares of our common stock.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will be required, pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (&#147;Section&nbsp;404&#148;), to furnish a report by management on,
among other things, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of the registration statement of which this Annual Report forms a part. This assessment will need to
include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS
Act&#148;). At such time as we are required to obtain auditor attestation, if we then have a material weakness, we would receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public
accounting firm. We will be required to disclose significant changes made in our internal controls procedures on a quarterly basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have begun the
costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section&nbsp;404, and we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation
in a timely fashion. Our compliance with Section&nbsp;404 will require that we incur substantial legal, accounting and other compliance expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will
need to hire additional accounting and finance staff and consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply
with Section&nbsp;404. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal
controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls
over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to
conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls over financial reporting, we
could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory
authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also negatively impact our ability to access to
the capital markets. </P>

compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the fifth anniversary of the closing of
HSAC&#146;s initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07&nbsp;billion or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of shares of our

delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will
be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even after we no longer
qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company,&#148; which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including exemption from compliance with the
auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this Annual Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot predict if investors will find shares of our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find shares of

centrally managed and controlled in the U. K., and, under current U. K. tax law, a company which is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. is regarded as resident in the U. K. for taxation purposes. Accordingly, we expect ISL to be subject to
U.K. taxation on its income and gains and subject to the U.K.&#146;s controlled foreign company rules, except where an exemption applies. ISL may be treated as a dual resident company for U.K. tax purposes. As a result, ISL&#146;s right to claim
certain reliefs from U.K. tax may be restricted, and changes in law or practice in the U.K. could result in the imposition of further restrictions on ISL&#146;s right to claim U.K. tax reliefs. ISL may also become subject to income, withholding or
other taxes in certain jurisdictions by reason of its activities and operations, and it is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert that ISL is subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. Any such
additional tax liability could adversely affect our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The intended tax effects of our corporate structure and intercompany

ISL, and our controlling stockholder, RSL, are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and are tax residents of the U.K. Further, we currently have other subsidiaries that are domiciled in the U. K., Switzerland and the United States. If we succeed
in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased operations through our subsidiaries in various countries and tax jurisdictions, in part through intercompany service agreements between us, our parent company and our subsidiaries. In that
case, our corporate structure and intercompany transactions, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, will be organized so that we can achieve our business objectives in a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-efficient</FONT> manner and in compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules and regulations. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries or tax jurisdictions, the tax laws and
regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms&#146; length and that appropriate documentation be maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe
that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully
challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms&#146; length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax
liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to
a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income
taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we intend to operate in numerous countries and taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging
and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which
the arm&#146;s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are
issued or applied. Moreover, certain relevant tax, accounting and other laws have special application with respect to &#147;affiliated,&#148; &#147;combined&#148; or similar groups, which may include RSL, ISL and their respective subsidiaries, and
which may impact the tax liabilities of the companies. We continue to assess the impact of such changes in tax laws on our business and may determine that changes to our structure, practice or tax positions are necessary in light of such changes and
developments in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such changes may nevertheless be ineffective in avoiding an increase in our consolidated tax liability, which could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax rates, tax laws, tax practice, tax treaties or tax regulations or changes in the interpretation
thereof by the tax authorities in Europe (including the U.K. and Switzerland), the United States, Bermuda and other jurisdictions as well as being affected by certain changes currently proposed by the Organization for Economic <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Co-operation</FONT> and Development and their action plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Such changes may become more likely as a result of recent economic trends in the jurisdictions in which we operate,
particularly if such trends continue. If such a situation was to arise, it could adversely impact our tax position and our effective tax rate. Failure to manage the risks associated with such changes, or misinterpretation of the laws providing such
changes, could result in costly audits, interest, penalties and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, results of our operations and our financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax
rates, including: (1)&nbsp;the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; (2)&nbsp;the resolution of issues arising from any future tax audits with various tax authorities; (3)&nbsp;changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities; (4)&nbsp;increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; (5)&nbsp;changes in the taxation of stock-based compensation;
(6)&nbsp;changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and (7)&nbsp;challenges to the transfer pricing policies related to our structure. </P>

units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $115.0&nbsp;million. Chardan Capital Markets LLC and UBS Securities LLC acted as joint book running managers. The securities sold in the IPO were registered
under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-1</FONT> (No. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">333-230893)</FONT> which was declared effective on May&nbsp;9, 2019. </P>

warrant, generating total proceeds of $5.0&nbsp;million. The private warrants were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. On December&nbsp;18, 2019, upon the closing of the

we were known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation. On December&nbsp;18, 2019, we completed the Business Combination, with Immunovant Sciences Ltd., a private company. For accounting purposes, Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation was
deemed to be the acquired entity. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for patients with autoimmune diseases. We are developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RVT-1401),</FONT> that selectively binds to and inhibits the FcRn. IMVT-1401 is the product of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. to design a highly potent anti-FcRn
antibody optimized for subcutaneous delivery. These efforts have resulted in a product candidate that has been dosed in small volumes (e.g. 2 mL) and with a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">27-gauge</FONT> needle, while still generating
therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, IMVT-1401 has been observed to reduce IgG
antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe IMVT-1401 has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 in autoimmune
diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule. As a result
of our rational design, we believe that IMVT-1401, if approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">IgG-mediated</FONT> autoimmune diseases,
(e.g., MG, TED, WAIHA, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, bullous pemphigoid, neuromyelitis optica, pemphigus foliaceus, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome and PLA2R+ membranous
nephropathy). In 2019, these diseases had an aggregate prevalence of approximately 243,000 patients in the United States and 388,000 patients in Europe. To the extent we choose to develop IMVT-1401 for certain of these rare diseases, we plan to seek
orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. However, we have not yet sought such
designation for any of our three target indications, and there is no certainty that it would obtain such designation, or maintain the benefits associated with such designation, if or when we do. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND MG trial, a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with MG. We expect to report results from the
placebo-controlled treatment phase of this trial in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of calendar year 2020. In May 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-1 trial, a Phase 2a clinical trial in Canada in patients with TED. We
announced initial results from this trial in March 2020. Enrollment is ongoing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a Phase 2b clinical trial for TED in the United States, Canada and Europe. As previously communicated, results from this trial are still
possible in the first half of calendar year 2021. We intend to provide an update on the timing for this trial in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. In November 2019, we submitted an IND to the FDA for WAIHA and, in December 2019, our IND was
cleared for Phase 2 trial initiation. As previously communicated, results from this trial are still possible by the end of second half of calendar year 2020. We intend to provide an update on the timing for this trial in the third quarter of
calendar year 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ISL was incorporated in July 2018 and its operations prior to the closing of the Business Combination were limited to organizing and
staffing ISL, acquiring the rights to IMVT-1401, and preparing for and conducting clinical trials. To date, we have not generated any revenue and have generated significant operating losses since our inception. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, we
had an accumulated deficit of $91.2&nbsp;million and $24.8&nbsp;million, respectively. For the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded net losses of $66.4&nbsp;million and $28.6&nbsp;million, respectively. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The COVID-19 pandemic had a variable impact on our clinical trials from March through June 2020. Some sites closed enrollment for new patients in early March
and remain closed today, whereas other sites remained partially open for new patient enrollment. At this time, we expect most sites globally to re-open for new enrollment in the coming months, but given the uncertain course of the pandemic this is
impossible to predict with certainty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the conduct of our business activities, we are also taking actions designed to protect the safety and well-being
of our patients and employees. For patients already enrolled in our clinical trials, we are working closely with clinical trial investigators and site staff to continue treatment in compliance with trial protocols and observe government and
institutional guidelines designed to safeguard the health and safety of patients, clinical trial investigators and site staff. Our very experienced clinical development team has successfully maintained robust communication with our sites. New
patients enrolled in our programs from March to June 2020 did not miss any in-person clinic visits during the initial treatment period. We have also been working with our partners to ensure that backup services are in place, which has enabled some
virtual visits to replace in-person visits during the follow-up period after initial treatment. These internal and external efforts have allowed us to continue progress across our clinical development programs. While we continue to evaluate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to provide an update on our clinical development timelines for TED and WAIHA in the third quarter of calendar year 2020. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The impact of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> on our future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain

year ended March&nbsp;31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to $10.0&nbsp;million related to the achievement of the first development and regulatory milestone under the HanAll Agreement in May 2019. Other increases mainly include higher clinical
trial costs of $7.5&nbsp;million, contract manufacturing costs of $5.7&nbsp;million, and other costs of $1.3&nbsp;million, all of which were driven by the advancement of our clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune disease, as well as higher
personnel-related expenses of $2.6&nbsp;million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.9&nbsp;million, both of which were due to higher headcount to support our clinical operations. The overall increase was partially offset by decreases in costs
billed to us under the Services Agreements of $4.9&nbsp;million, and nonclinical studies of $1.9&nbsp;million. </P>

support our higher operating activities and SEC filings. Additional increases include higher stock-based compensation expense of $3.7&nbsp;million and higher personnel-related costs of $3.8&nbsp;million, both of which were due to higher headcount,

activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net loss for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2020, $53.4&nbsp;million of cash was
used in operating activities. This was primarily attributable to a net loss from operations for the year of $66.4&nbsp;million, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> charges of $8.2&nbsp;million and a net change in operating assets and
liabilities of $4.8&nbsp;million. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $7.0&nbsp;million and $1.6&nbsp;million from the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">write-off</FONT> of
deferred offering costs. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $7.5&nbsp;million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by increased research and development efforts and general
and administrative activities, partially offset by an increase of $2.8&nbsp;million in prepaid expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2019,

partially offset by stock-based compensation of $1.3&nbsp;million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was due to an increase of $2.5&nbsp;million in prepaid expenses and an increase of $2.9&nbsp;million in the Swiss value-added tax
receivable related to the assignment of the HanAll License Agreement, partially offset by a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.0&nbsp;million due to a ramp up in our research and development efforts. </P>

June&nbsp;29, 2020 of approximately $280.4 million, our research and development plans and our timing expectations related to our development programs for IMVT-1401, we expect to be able to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements into the first half of 2022. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. </P>

March&nbsp;31, 2020, other than contingent payments pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, we did not have any ongoing material financial commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that we expect to affect our liquidity over the next several
years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for nonclinical studies, manufacturing
and other services and products for operating purposes, which agreements are cancelable by us at any time, subject to payment of remaining obligations under binding purchase orders and, in certain cases, nominal early-termination fees. These
commitments are not deemed significant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not included potential future payments due under the HanAll Agreement in a table of contractual
obligations because the payment obligations under this agreement are contingent upon future events. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, the aggregate maximum amount of milestone payments we could be required to make under the HanAll Agreement is
$442.5&nbsp;million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. In May 2019, we achieved our first development and regulatory milestone under the HanAll Agreement resulting in a $10.0&nbsp;million milestone
payment that was paid by us in August 2019. We are also required to reimburse HanAll for half of budgeted research and development costs incurred by HanAll with respect to IMVT-1401, up to an aggregate of $20.0&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our office leases are short-term in nature and cancelable at any time. Subsequent to March&nbsp;31, 2020, we entered into two sublease agreements with RSI for
office space expiring in 2024. For more information on such subleases, see &#147;Note 12 &#151; Subsequent Events&#148; to our combined and consolidated financial statements. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our combined and consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these combined and consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our combined and consolidated financial statements are derived by carving out the historical results of
operations and historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities associated with product candidate IMVT-1401, that have been contributed to us by RSL, from RSL&#146;s financial statements. Because the transfer of assets and liabilities in our
formation on July&nbsp;6, 2018 was between entities under the common control of RSL and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, our combined and consolidated financial statements have been presented as if we had been a separate business when RSG acquired
IMVT-1401 on December&nbsp;19, 2017, and accordingly, the assets, liabilities and expenses relating to our operations have been separated from RSL in the combined and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to and after our formation
through March&nbsp;31, 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and
judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies
are more fully described in &#147;Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148; to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following are the critical accounting
policies used in the preparation of our combined and consolidated financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards with graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We account for forfeitures as
they occur. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Term</I>. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined
using the simplified method (based on the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-point</FONT> between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Volatility</I>. Prior to the Business Combination, we were a privately-held company and did not have any trading history for our
common stock. The expected volatility was estimated using weighted average measures of implied volatility and the historical volatility of our peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. Our peer group of
publicly-traded biopharmaceutical companies was chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty. Because we do not have an extended trading history for our shares of common stock since the closing of the Business
Combination, the method used to estimate the expected volatility remained unchanged. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Risk-Free Interest Rate</I>. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the stock options. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expected Dividend</I>. We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our common stock. Therefore, the expected
dividend yield was assumed to be zero. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the fair value of our common stock was estimated on each grant
date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance
with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide,<I> Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common
stock, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including (1)&nbsp;our business, financial condition and
results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (2)&nbsp;our forecasted operating performance and projected future cash flows; (3)&nbsp;the illiquid nature of our common stock; (4)&nbsp;the rights and privileges of
our common stock; (5)&nbsp;market multiples of our most comparable public peers and (6)&nbsp;market conditions affecting our industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the closing
of the Business Combination, our board of directors determined the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock-based awards based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A component of total stock-based compensation expense relates to the RSL common stock awards and options issued by RSL to its employees. Stock-based
compensation expense is allocated to us by RSL based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL employees on our matters. The fair value of the RSL common stock awards is determined on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized
over the requisite service period. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards and options, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards and options are subject to specified vesting schedules
and requirements (a combination of time-based, performance-based and corporate event-based vesting terms, including targets for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-IPO</FONT> market capitalization and future financing events of RSL). The fair
value of each RSL option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs are accrued over the service periods specified in
the contracts and are adjusted as necessary based on an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to
regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of employee compensation, allocated costs from RSL and
expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities on our behalf. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, <I>Income Taxes</I>. Under the assets and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740.
When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based
upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, we did not have any significant uncertain tax positions. </P>

JOBS Act was enacted. Section&nbsp;107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay
the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised
accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent Accounting

for each of the two years in the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#147;combined and consolidated financial statements&#148;). In our opinion, the combined and consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March&nbsp;31, 2020, in conformity

statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP </P>

together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Immunovant&#148;) (formerly known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for patients
with autoimmune diseases. The Company is developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">RVT-1401),</FONT> that selectively binds to and inhibits the neonatal fragment
crystallizable receptor (FcRn). The Company intends to develop IMVT-1401 for indications in which there is robust evidence that pathogenic immunoglobulin G antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of these antibodies should
lead to clinical benefit for patients with autoimmune diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has determined that it has one operating and reporting segment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Reverse Recapitalization </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;18, 2019,
Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation (&#147;HSAC&#148;) completed the acquisition of Immunovant Sciences Ltd. (&#147;ISL&#148;) pursuant to the share exchange agreement dated as of September&nbsp;29, 2019 (the &#147;Share Exchange
Agreement&#148;), by and among HSAC, ISL, the stockholders of ISL (the &#147;Sellers&#148;), and Roivant Sciences Ltd. (&#147;RSL&#148;), as representative of the Sellers (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;). As of immediately prior to the closing
of the Business Combination, the Sellers owned 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of ISL (&#147;ISL Shares&#148;). At the closing of the Business Combination, HSAC acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ISL Shares, in exchange for
42,080,376 shares of HSAC&#146;s common stock issued to the Sellers and 10,000 shares of HSAC Series A preferred stock issued to RSL (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, ISL became a wholly owned
subsidiary of HSAC and HSAC was renamed &#147;Immunovant, Inc.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and HSAC
was treated as the &#147;acquired&#148; company for accounting purposes. The Business Combination was accounted as the equivalent of ISL issuing stock for the net assets of HSAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. Accordingly, all historical
financial information presented in these combined and consolidated financial statements represents the accounts of ISL and its wholly owned subsidiaries &#147;as if&#148; ISL is the predecessor to the Company. The shares and net loss per common
share, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination (0.48906624 Immunovant, Inc. shares for 1 ISL Share). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ISL was founded on July&nbsp;6, 2018 as a Bermuda exempted limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL. In July and August 2018, ISL incorporated its
wholly owned subsidiaries, Immunovant Sciences Holdings Ltd. (&#147;ISHL&#148;), a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the laws of England and Wales, IMVT Corporation (formerly, Immunovant, Inc.), a Delaware corporation
based in the United States of America, and Immunovant Sciences GmbH (&#147;ISG&#148;), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Switzerland. ISG holds all of the Company&#146;s intellectual property rights. HSAC was incorporated in
Delaware on December&nbsp;6, 2018 and was formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more
businesses. References herein to &#147;date of formation&#148; or &#147;date of inception&#148; refer to the founding of ISL. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the closing of the
Business Combination, HSAC common stock, units and warrants were traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the ticker symbols &#147;HSAC,&#148; &#147;HSACU&#148; and &#147;HSACW,&#148; respectively. On December&nbsp;19, 2019,
the Company&#146;s common stock, units and warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols &#147;IMVT&#148;, &#147;IMVTU&#148; and &#147;IMVTW,&#148; respectively. One of the primary purposes of the Business Combination was to provide a
platform for ISL to gain access to the U.S. capital markets. See Note 3 &#150; Business Combination and Recapitalization for additional details on the Business Combination. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, the Company&#146;s cash
totaled $100.6&nbsp;million and its accumulated deficit was $91.2&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the Business Combination, ISL&#146;s operations were financed
through capital contributions from RSL or RSL&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries, Roivant Sciences Inc. (&#147;RSI&#148;) and Roivant Sciences GmbH (&#147;RSG&#148;), the issuance of equity instruments, and the issuance of promissory notes. The
Company has not generated any revenues to date and does not anticipate generating any revenues unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. Management expects
to incur additional losses in the future to fund its operations and conduct product research and development and recognizes the need to raise additional capital to fully implement its business plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company intends to raise such additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, debt financings or other sources in order to further implement
its business plan. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company will need to reevaluate its operating plan and may be required to delay the development of its product candidates. Based on anticipated spend and timing
of expenditure assumptions, the Company currently expects that its existing cash as of March&nbsp;31, 2020 together with funds raised in April 2020 and proceeds from warrants redemption as detailed in Note 12 &#150; Subsequent Events, will be
sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2022 from the date the combined and consolidated financial statements are issued. </P>

fiscal year ends on March&nbsp;31, and its first three fiscal quarters end on June&nbsp;30, September&nbsp;30, and December 31. The accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;)
and Accounting Standards Updates (&#147;ASU&#148;) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to July&nbsp;6, 2018 (date of
formation), the Company&#146;s financial statements were derived by carving out the historical results of operations and historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities associated with product candidate IMVT-1401, that have been contributed to
the Company by RSL, from RSL&#146;s financial statements. Because the transfer of assets and liabilities in the formation of the Company were between entities under the common control of RSL and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries, the financial
statements of the Company have been presented as if the Company had been a separate business since the acquisition of IMVT-1401 by RSG on December&nbsp;19, 2017. Prior to July&nbsp;6, 2018 (date of formation), the Company&#146;s financial statements
include reasonable allocations for assets and liabilities and expenses attributable to the Company&#146;s operations. Beginning on July&nbsp;6, 2018 (date of formation), the combined and consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company has no unconsolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company believes that the assumptions underlying the allocations of expenses as well as assets and liabilities in financial information are reasonable,
however, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may have been materially different if the Company had operated as a stand-alone entity prior to July&nbsp;6, 2018 (date of formation). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has calculated its income tax amounts using a separate return methodology and it has presented these amounts as if it were a separate taxpayer
from RSL. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;) was enacted. Section&nbsp;107(b) of the JOBS Act
provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those
standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has irrevocably elected not to avail itself of this extended transition period, and, as a result, the Company will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on
which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. </P>

and consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company
regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to assets, liabilities, stock-based compensation, research and development costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other
factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the Company assessed the impact of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic has had on its
operations and financial results as of March&nbsp;31, 2020 and through the issuance of this report. The Company&#146;s analysis was informed by the facts and circumstances as they were known to the Company. This assessment considered the impact <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> may have on financial estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[C] Risks and Uncertainties </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is
subject to risks common to early stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to commercialization of products, regulatory approvals, dependence on key products, third-party service providers
such as contract research organizations, protection of intellectual property rights and the ability to make milestone, royalty or other payments due under any license, collaboration or supply agreements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[D] Concentration of Credit Risk </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk include cash. At March&nbsp;31, 2020, the cash balance is kept in one banking institution that the Company believes is of high credit quality and is in excess of
federally insured levels. The Company maintains its cash with an accredited financial institution and accordingly, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[E] Cash and Cash Equivalents </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. At March&nbsp;31, 2020, cash consisted of cash held at a financial institution. There were no cash equivalents
as of March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[F] Property and Equipment </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Property and equipment, consisting of computers, is recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets
are expensed to operations as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three years. Upon disposal, retirement or sale, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the combined and consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[G] Impairment of Long-lived Assets
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company reviews the recoverability of all long-lived assets, including the related useful lives, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the book values of the assets to future net undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the book value of the assets exceed their fair value, which is measured based on the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the
assets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company, from time to time, may be a party to various disputes and claims arising from normal business activities. The Company continually assesses
litigation to determine if an unfavorable outcome would lead to a probable loss or reasonably possible loss which could be estimated. The Company accrues for all contingencies at the earliest date at which the Company deems it probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the Company accrues the minimum of the range. In the
cases where the Company believes that a reasonably possible loss exists, the Company discloses the facts and circumstances of the litigation, including an estimable range, if possible. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>[I] Research and Development Expense </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and
development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in
the period incurred as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of product sales over the remaining useful life of the asset. Research and development expenses
primarily consist of employee-related costs and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities on behalf of the Company. The estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service
providers, which primarily include the conduct of clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities, are accrued over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort
and costs actually incurred. The estimate of the work completed is developed through discussions with internal personnel and external services providers as to the progress toward completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such
services. As actual costs become known, the accrued estimates are adjusted. Such estimates are not expected to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, however the Company&#146;s understanding of the status and timing of services
performed, the number of subjects enrolled, and the rate of subject enrollment may vary from estimates and could result in reporting amounts that are higher or lower than incurred in any particular period. The estimate of accrued research and
development expense is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. </P>

<I>Leases</I>, as adopted by the Company on April&nbsp;1, 2019, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">right-of-use</FONT></FONT>
(&#147;ROU&#148;) assets represent the Company&#146;s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Company&#146;s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term
at commencement date calculated using the Company&#146;s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease asset, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. Operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease
commencement and exclude any lease incentives received. The Company determines the lease term as the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cancelable</FONT> period of the lease and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is
reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the combined and consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for lease and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-lease</FONT> components as a single lease component
for all its facilities leases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s leases are short-term in nature and cancelable at any time. Subsequent to March&nbsp;31, 2020, the
Company entered into two sublease agreements with RSI for office space expiring in 2024. For more information on such subleases, see Note 12 &#151; Subsequent Events. </P>

change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the accompanying combined and consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a
determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-planning</FONT> strategies
and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions
to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the
available facts and circumstances. The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in provision for income taxes. </P>

to employees and directors are valued at fair value on the date of the grant and that fair value is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards with graded
vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The Company values its stock options that only have service vesting requirements or performance-based
awards without market conditions using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For performance-based awards with market conditions, the Company determines the fair value of awards as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain assumptions need to be made with respect to utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, including the expected life of the award, volatility of
the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock. Since the Company has no option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award
based upon the &#147;simplified method&#148; with the continued use of this method extended until such time the Company has sufficient exercise history. The expected share price volatility for the Company&#146;s common stock is estimated by taking
the average historical price volatility for industry peers. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the equity award. As the Company has never
paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. The Company accounts for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-vesting</FONT> award forfeitures when they occur. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the valuation of stock-based compensation under the Black-Scholes option pricing model, it is necessary for the Company to estimate the fair value
of its common stock. Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock was estimated on each grant date by the Company&#146;s board of directors. Given the absence of a public trading market, and in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#146; Practice Guide, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>, the Company exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous
objective and subjective factors to determine its best estimate of the fair value of its common stock. The estimation of the fair value of the common stock considered factors including the following: the estimated present value of the Company&#146;s
future cash flows; the Company&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations; the Company&#146;s forecasted operating performance; the illiquid nature of the Company&#146;s common stock; industry information such as market size and
growth; market capitalization of comparable companies and the estimated value of transactions such companies have engaged in; and macroeconomic conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the closing of the Business Combination, the Company&#146;s board of directors determined the fair value of each share of common stock underlying
stock-based awards based on the closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Determining the appropriate
amount to expense for performance-based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment. The estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are
made as appropriate. The cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change. If any applicable financial performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is
reversed. </P>

that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value
hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Note 3 &#151; Business Combination and Recapitalization </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed in Note 1, on December&nbsp;18, 2019, HSAC completed the acquisition of ISL and acquired 100% of the ISL Shares in exchange for 42,080,376 shares
of HSAC common stock issued to the Sellers and 10,000 shares of HSAC Series A preferred stock issued to RSL. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization whereby HSAC was treated as the &#147;acquired&#148; company for
accounting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business Combination, the Sellers have a majority of the voting power of the combined company, ISL will comprise all of the ongoing operations of the
combined entity, a majority of the governing body of the combined company, and ISL&#146;s senior management will comprise all of the senior management of the combined company. The Business Combination was accounted as the equivalent of ISL issuing
stock for the net assets of HSAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of HSAC were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Reported amounts from operations included herein prior to the Business
Combination are those of ISL. The shares, options and net loss per share available to holders of the Company&#146;s common stock, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established
in the Business Combination (0.48906624 Immunovant, Inc. shares for 1 ISL Share). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The aggregate value of the consideration paid by HSAC in the Business
Combination was $420.9&nbsp;million, consisting of 42,080,376 shares of HSAC&#146;s common stock and 10,000 shares of HSAC&#146;s Series A preferred stock, in each case, valued at $10.00 per share (the deemed value of the shares issued pursuant to
the Share Exchange Agreement). The closing price per share on the date of the closing of the Business Combination on December&nbsp;18, 2019 was $13.88. As the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, the $10.00 per share
value is disclosed for informational purposes only in order to indicate the fair value of shares transferred. In addition, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, all vested or unvested outstanding options to purchase common shares of ISL under
its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan were automatically assumed by the Company and converted into options to purchase 4,408,287 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock with no changes to the terms of the awards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Business Combination and Recapitalization, the Company incurred direct and incremental costs of $2.8&nbsp;million, consisting of legal,
accounting, financial advisory and other professional fees, which are included in additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital in the combined and consolidated balance sheets as of March&nbsp;31, 2020. The Company incurred
additional financial advisory fees related to the Business Combination of $2.3&nbsp;million that have been included in general and administrative expense within the accompanying combined and consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
March&nbsp;31, 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination, there were 56,455,376 shares of common stock issued, 54,655,376 shares
of common stock outstanding, 10,000 shares of Series A preferred stock and 11,500,000 warrants to purchase 5,750,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. </P>

registration rights agreement (the &#147;Registration Rights Agreement&#148;), which became effective as of the closing of the Business Combination. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Sponsor and the Sellers hold registration rights that
obligate the Company to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) held by the Sponsor and the

registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities, so long as such shares are not then restricted under certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lock-up</FONT> agreements. Subject to certain exceptions, if the
Company proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Company&#146;s securities, under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will give notice to the Sponsor and the Sellers as to the proposed filing
and offer such stockholders an opportunity to register the resale of such number of their Registrable Securities as they request in writing, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, such stockholders will be
entitled under the Registration Rights Agreement to request in writing that the Company register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-3</FONT> or any other registration statement that

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the agreements discussed in Note 4, in August 2018, the Company entered into services agreement (the &#147;Services Agreements&#148;) with RSI
and RSG, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to the Company during its formative period. Under each Services Agreement, the Company will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as
applicable, for any expenses it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incurs for the Company. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back
the employee compensation expense plus a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-determined</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mark-up.</FONT> RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such
costs have been recognized by the Company in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on Company
matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements will continue until terminated by the Company, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days&#146; written notice. The combined and consolidated financial statements
also include third-party expenses that have been paid by RSI, RSG and RSL since the inception of the Company. Total expense, inclusive of salary, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation, is proportionately allocated to the Company based upon
the relative percentage of time utilized on the Company&#146;s matters. For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2020, the Company was charged $1.4&nbsp;million by RSI, RSG and RSL of which $1.2&nbsp;million and $0.2&nbsp;million were treated as capital
contributions and amounts due to Roivant Sciences Ltd., respectively, in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements. For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2019, the Company was charged $2.3&nbsp;million by RSI, RSG and RSL of which
$2.2&nbsp;million and $0.1&nbsp;million were treated as capital contributions and amounts due to Roivant Sciences Ltd., respectively, in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;11, 2019, the Company entered into an interest-free promissory note payable with RSL in the amount of $5.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;June
Promissory Note&#148;). The June Promissory Note was due and payable at the earlier of December&nbsp;12, 2019 or upon demand by RSL. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;7, 2019, the Company replaced the June Promissory Note and entered into a convertible
promissory note with RSL in the amount of $5.0&nbsp;million (the &#147;RSL Convertible Promissory Note&#148;) under the same terms as other convertible promissory notes entered into with RTW Master Fund, Ltd. and RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd.
(the &#147;RTW Entities&#148;) (see Note 8). On September&nbsp;26, 2019, $2.5&nbsp;million principal amount of the RSL Convertible Promissory Note was prepaid and the accrued interest on such principal amount was forgiven, bringing the principal
balance of the RSL Convertible Promissory Note to $2.5&nbsp;million. Immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the remaining $2.5&nbsp;million principal balance of the RSL Convertible Promissory note was automatically converted
into an aggregate of 511,178 ISL Shares, which were then exchanged for an aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination. In accordance with the terms of the RSL Convertible Promissory
Note, all interest on the RSL Convertible Promissory Note was waived and canceled immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination and recorded in additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital upon conversion of the
underlying note. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;17, 2019, the Company entered into an interest-free promissory note payable with RSL in the amount of $2.9&nbsp;million
(the &#147;July Promissory Note&#148;). The July Promissory Note has a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">180-day</FONT> term and is payable on demand upon the expiration of the term. The July Promissory Note along with $0.3&nbsp;million other
payables due to RSL are included in amounts due to Roivant Sciences Ltd. in the accompanying combined and consolidated balance sheets as of March&nbsp;31, 2020. In May 2020, the Company paid and settled the July Promissory Note with RSL. See Note 12
&#150; Subsequent Events for details related to the repayment of the July Promissory Note. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement (the &#147;Cooperation
Agreement&#148;) with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1)&nbsp;obligates the Company to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial
reporting requirements; (2)&nbsp;requires the Company to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3)&nbsp;requires the Company to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related
to applicable laws and regulations. The Company has agreed to indemnify RSL and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with RSL&#146;s status as a stockholder
under the Cooperation Agreement and the operations of or services provided by RSL or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees or directors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations set forth in the
Cooperation Agreement. No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, the Company believes this agreement is material to its business and operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the mutual written consent of the parties or
(2)&nbsp;the later of when RSL no longer (a)&nbsp;is required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in the Company under the equity method of accounting or, by any
rule of the SEC, include the Company&#146;s separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b)&nbsp;has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of the Company&#146;s board of directors. </P>

approximately $67.7&nbsp;million, which will expire as of March&nbsp;31, 2027, the United Kingdom of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with an annual usage limitation, and the United States of approximately
$1.9&nbsp;million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with an annual usage limitation. The Company has research and development credit carryforwards in the United States in the amount of $1.5&nbsp;million which will begin to expire in the
fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 2039. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company assesses the realizability of the net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date based on
available positive and negative evidence in order to determine the amount which is more likely than not to be realized and record a valuation allowance as necessary. Due to the Company&#146;s cumulative loss position which provides significant
negative evidence difficult to overcome, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $19.1&nbsp;million for the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2020, and $8.9&nbsp;million for the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2019, representing the portion of the net
deferred tax assets that is not more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted for future factors that would impact the assessment of the objective and subjective evidence of
the Company. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date in order to determine the proper amount, if any, required for a valuation allowance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company intends that undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries of approximately $2.0&nbsp;million are to be indefinitely reinvested. Should these
earnings be distributed in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to withholding taxes and income taxes. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities, including any withholding taxes, on
these undistributed earnings are expected to be immaterial and have not been recorded. The Company regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating
and liquidity needs of the Company. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws, or the Company&#146;s financial situation could result in a change to the Company&#146;s position. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to tax and files income tax returns in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and United States federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The
Company&#146;s March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019 tax returns remain open for tax examinations in all applicable income tax jurisdictions. Tax audits and examinations can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments. The resolution of matters may
span multiple years particularly if subject to litigation or negotiation. The Company believes it has appropriately recorded its tax position using reasonable estimates and assumptions, however the potential tax benefits may impact the combined and
consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period of resolution, settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. There are no uncertain tax benefits recorded as of March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2019, the Sponsor purchased from HSAC an aggregate of 10,000,000 warrants (the &#147;private warrants&#148;) at $0.50 per private warrant (for a total
purchase price of $5.0 million), with each warrant exercisable for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share simultaneously with the closing of HSAC&#146;s IPO in May 2019.
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, all of the private warrants were canceled upon the closing of the Business Combination. The Company did not recognize any expense on the cancelation of the private warrants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, 11,500,000 warrants were outstanding for the purchase <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of one share of common stock
(an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares) at a price of $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustment. The warrants were issued by HSAC as part of the units sold in its IPO in May 2019 and are classified in equity. The warrants are exercisable commencing
on May&nbsp;14, 2020 and expire in December 2024 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The warrants are redeemable, at the Company&#146;s option, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, upon a minimum of 30 days&#146; prior
written notice of redemption, and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company&#146;s common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-trading</FONT> day period ending on the
third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends a notice of redemption to the warrant holders. The warrant holders have 30 days to exercise the warrants upon receipt of notice of redemption. See Note 3 &#150; Business Combination and

Equity Incentive Plan </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2019, in connection with the Business Combination, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved the 2019 Equity
Incentive Plan (the &#147;2019 Plan&#148;) and reserved 5,500,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The 2019 Plan became effective immediately upon the closing of the Business Combination. The number of shares of common stock reserved
for issuance under the 2019 Plan will automatically increase on April&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on April&nbsp;1, 2020 and continuing through April&nbsp;1, 2029, by 4.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day
of the preceding month, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive options under the 2019 Plan is 16,500,000. The
Company&#146;s employees, directors and consultants are eligible to receive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-qualified</FONT> and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other
stock awards, and performance awards under the plan. Generally, each option will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</FONT>
contractual term. For grants of incentive stock options, if the grantee owns, or is deemed to own, 10% or more of the total voting power of the Company, then the exercise price shall be 110% of the fair market value of the Company&#146;s common
stock on the date of grant and the option will have a five-year contractual term. Options that are forfeited, canceled or have expired are available for future grants. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, options to purchase 216,480 shares of common stock had
been granted under the 2019 Plan and 5,283,520 shares remained available for future grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>2018 Equity Incentive Plan </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2018, ISL adopted its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;2018 Plan&#148;), under which 3,667,997 shares of common stock were reserved for
grant. In July 2019, the 2018 Plan was amended and restated to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for grant to 4,768,396. As discussed in Note 3, upon the closing of the Business Combination, the Company assumed all outstanding
options, whether or not vested, under the 2018 Plan, with such options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock equal to approximately 0.48906624 multiplied by the number of shares of ISL
common stock previously represented by such options. For accounting purposes, however, the Company is deemed to have assumed the 2018 Plan. The exchange of the stock options did not result in any incremental compensation expense, since there were no
changes to the vesting terms of the awards. As of the effective date of the 2019 Plan, no further stock awards have been or will be made under 2018 Plan. As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, 3,657,408 stock options were outstanding under the 2018 Plan. </P>

$0.2&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million was recorded for years ended March&nbsp;31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the accompanying combined and consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The RSL common share awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. Significant
judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a mix of time-based and performance-based events). The
fair value of each RSL common share award is based on various corporate event-based considerations, including targets for RSL&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-IPO</FONT> market capitalization and future financing events. The fair value
of each RSL option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense is allocated to the
Company over the required service period over which these RSL common share awards and RSL options would vest and is based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL, RSI, and RSG employees on Company matters. </P>

across a range of industries. Currently, the Company has not suffered significant adverse consequences as a result of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> pandemic, but the extent of the impact of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> on the Company&#146;s future operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on employees and vendors all of which
are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">COVID-19</FONT> may impact the Company&#146;s future financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of March&nbsp;31, 2020, the Company did not have any ongoing material financial commitments. The Company expects to enter into other commitments as the
business further develops. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of its research and development activities. Subject to required notice periods and the
Company&#146;s obligations under binding purchase orders, the Company can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. The Company expects to enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, and
supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and long-term commitments of capital resources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Note 12 &#151; Subsequent Events

$2.9&nbsp;million of the Swiss value-added tax receivable that is included in the combined and consolidated balance sheet as of March&nbsp;31, 2020. In May 2020, the proceeds were used to repay the July Promissory Note which is payable to RSL in the
