We were incorporated in Delaware in December 2018 as a blank check company under the name Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation (&#8220;HSAC&#8221;). On December 18, 2019, Immunovant Sciences Ltd. (&#8220;ISL&#8221;), and HSAC consummated the transactions contemplated under that certain share exchange agreement dated as of September 29, 2019 by and among HSAC, ISL, the stockholders of ISL and Roivant Sciences Ltd., following the approval at the special meeting of the stockholders of HSAC held on December 16, 2019, which we refer to as the Business Combination. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name from HSAC to Immunovant, Inc.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our innovative product pipeline includes batoclimab, formerly referred to as IMVT-1401, and IMVT-1402, both of which are novel, fully human monoclonal antibodies that target the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (&#8220;FcRn&#8221;). Batoclimab and IMVT-1402 are the result of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by us and HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (&#8220;HanAll&#8221;) to design highly potent anti-FcRn antibodies that may be optimized as a simple, subcutaneous injection with dosing that we believe can be tailored based on disease severity and stage.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Batoclimab, our first product candidate, has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, batoclimab has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G (&#8220;IgG&#8221;) antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe batoclimab has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Likewise, IMVT-1402, our second product candidate, has also been observed in nonclinical studies to reduce IgG antibody levels. Importantly, based on the anticipated human effective dose levels, the human equivalent doses of IMVT-1402 have demonstrated minimal or no impact on levels of albumin and low-density lipoprotein (&#8220;LDL&#8221;) cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys. This is a key attribute for IMVT-1402, which we believe could potentially allow its use as a treatment of chronic conditions requiring maintenance doses that achieve high degrees of IgG suppression. We are developing batoclimab and IMVT-1402 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Autoimmune diseases are conditions where an immune response is inappropriately directed against the body&#8217;s own healthy cells and tissues. According to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, more than 50 million people in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) suffer from one of more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Predisposing factors may include genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and other factors not yet known. Many of these diseases are associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, which are the most abundant type of antibody produced by the human immune system, accounting for approximately 75% of antibodies in the plasma of healthy people. IgG antibodies are important in the defense against pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. In IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases (an important subset of autoimmune diseases), IgG antibodies inappropriately develop against normal proteins found in the body, directing the immune system to attack specific organs or organ systems.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Unfortunately, safe and effective treatment options for patients suffering from many autoimmune diseases are lacking. Historically available treatments are generally limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in early-stage disease and intravenous immunoglobulin (&#8220;IVIg&#8221;) or plasma exchange in later-stage disease. These approaches often fail to address patients&#8217; needs since they are limited by delayed onset of action, waning therapeutic benefit over time and unfavorable safety profiles.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The physiologic function of FcRn is to prevent the degradation of IgG antibodies.

The clinical course of MG is variable but usually progressive, and patients tend to experience fluctuating symptoms. There is an estimated prevalence of 18 cases of MG per 100,000 people in the U.S. For women, disease onset typically occurs around their 20s and 30s, whereas for men it peaks in their 50s and 60s. Overall, MG affects women more frequently than men. The disease is most often caused by autoantibodies that target the acetylcholine receptor or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase receptor at the neuromuscular junction, disrupting normal muscular function. Symptoms typically emerge in the eyes (e.g., drooping eyelids, double vision, blurred vision) and progress into the face, throat, or limbs. Some patients may experience life-threatening respiratory complications due to the weakening of muscles involved in respiration.

It is a progressive and clinically variable disease that can become debilitating, disfiguring, or sight-threatening. The incidence of TED in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately 10 per 100,000. TED can be caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (&#8220;TSHR&#8221;). These antibodies, which also cause Graves&#8217; disease, target the extraocular space and result in clinical manifestations of the disease. Common signs of disease include proptosis (eye bulging), tearing, periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes), redness, dry eyes, eye irritation, and pain behind the eyes; in severe cases, double vision or vision loss may occur.

Though the clinical course of CIDP can be variable, it is typically a chronic progressive disease if left untreated. CIDP is a rare disease that can occur in any age group, with peak onset being in the 60s and 70s. CIDP affects men twice as much as women. Its prevalence is estimated to be almost nine per 100,000 people in the U.S. CIDP appears to be mediated, at least in some patients, by IgG antibodies that are directed against targets in the myelin sheath; however, the specific target of these antibodies is not yet established. The hallmark signs of CIDP are weakness, tingling sensations, or loss of sensation in the arms and legs that is symmetrical and gradually worsens.

Although GD can affect any age group or gender, it occurs often in women younger than 40 years of age with an estimated incidence of 35 per 100,000 people in the U.S. The disease is mediated by thyroid-stimulating IgG antibodies that cause the thyroid gland to produce an excess of thyroid hormones, resulting in systemic manifestations that affect multiple organs. Patients typically present with classic signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, and frequent bowel movements. The disease can also manifest with ophthalmopathy (e.g., eye redness, swelling, bulging) or dermopathy. If left untreated, patients may develop arrhythmias, heart failure, or life-threatening thyroid storms.

MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration. Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine receptor (&#8220;AChR&#8221;) antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The prevalence of MG is estimated to be 18 per 100,000 people, with up to 59,000 cases in the U.S. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in people between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in people over 50 years old and predominantly affects males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital.</span></div><div style="padding-left:9pt;text-indent:-9pt"><span><br/></span></div><div style="padding-left:9pt;text-indent:-9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Current Treatment Paradigm</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Very early-stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies via plasma exchange or a variant of this plasma exchange, immunoadsorption. The most recent agents approved for MG are eculizumab and ravulizumAb-cwvz, two complement C5 inhibitors, the use of which are limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment, was recently approved for the treatment of MG in adult patients who are anti-AChR antibody positive. We believe there is room to improve upon this current treatment paradigm for MG, as some of these treatments can leave patients with burdensome administration requirements, significant side effects or long wait times to see treatment effect.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In 2019, we initiated a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of batoclimab for the treatment of MG.

Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision, and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. At diagnosis, many patients with TED have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes, and protrusion of their eyeballs (proptosis). In some cases, swelling and stiffness of the eye muscles prevent the eyes from working together causing double vision. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease causing intense pain, inflammation, sight-threatening corneal ulcers, or optic neuropathy requiring surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED patients.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">11</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the TSHR. These anti-TSHR antibodies activate cells in the extraocular space that highly express TSHR, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Fibroblast activation causes cell proliferation and the production of hyaluronan, a substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes leading to extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling. Adipocyte activation leads to hyperplasia of the adipose tissue surrounding the eye causing protrusion of the eyeballs and compression of the optic nerve. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis. Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, leads to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition to anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (&#8220;IGF1R&#8221;) may also contribute to TED. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation of similar biochemical pathways implicated in TED. Published studies investigating this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggests that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">TED has an estimated annual incidence of ten in 100,000 people in the U.S. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Treatment of patients with immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the U.S. have active TED each year and are eligible for treatment with therapy directed at the causative anti-TSHR antibodies.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Current Treatment Paradigm</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high doses of corticosteroids, typically administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately one-third of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression.

Worldwide, the reported prevalence of CIDP ranges from 0.8 to 8.9 per 100,000 persons. The average age of onset is about 50 years, with relapsing disease course associated with younger age of patients, and men are predominantly affected in an approximately 2:1 ratio relative to women.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">CIDP typically presents with progressive or relapsing, symmetric involvement of both proximal and distal extremity muscle weakness over the course of several weeks. The pathophysiology of CIDP is not completely understood. However, it is thought that an inciting process such as molecular mimicry causes activation of autoreactive T cells. Activated T cells cross the blood-nerve barrier (&#8220;BNB&#8221;) via adhesion molecules and diapedesis, where they secrete metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase the permeability of the BNB and stimulate autoantibody production by plasma cells. The damaged BNB permits passage of soluble factors such as autoantibodies and activated macrophages, which also release pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species thus propagating the inflammatory cycle. Upon accessing the nerve, autoantibodies can bind to neuronal proteins including myelin glycoproteins resulting in axonal degeneration and demyelination. Autoantibody induced degeneration and demyelination causes characteristic electrophysiologic alterations of the peripheral nerves and is clinically manifested by the sensorimotor deficits of CIDP.  </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">13</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Current Treatment Paradigm</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">With respect to clinical management, IVIg, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange (&#8220;PLEX&#8221;) are considered as first-line therapy in the treatment of CIDP. The treatment paradigm involves initiation of therapy with one of these three agents. For patients who fail to achieve objective improvement (i.e., of impairment and disability) after 3 months of treatment, a second or third first line agent may be tried. Alternative options include rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine, although there is limited evidence supporting their use as treatments for CIDP. Once objective improvement is achieved, the patient may be switched to maintenance treatment, the goal of which is to reduce the dose or frequency of treatment to the minimum effective level. For maintenance therapy, patients may be switched from IVIg to subcutaneous immunoglobulin (&#8220;SCIg&#8221;); and immunomodulatory agents such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate may be used for IVIg dose-reducing, corticosteroid-sparing or PLEX frequency-reducing effect. Increasing the dose or frequency of treatment or combining treatments is a consideration for patients who continue to experience active disease. For long term management of clinically stable patients, therapy should be periodically reduced or stopped to assess if treatment is still required.  </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Despite the availability of the therapies described above, there remains significant unmet medical need for patients with CIDP. For example, although immunoglobulin therapy (IVIg, SCIg) is effective, it may be associated with significant side effects and complications such as severe headache, thromboembolism, and hemolysis. Additionally, IVIg therapy imposes a burden on patients&#8217; time and requires in-person attendance visits at infusion center access to home health agency support for at-home administration remains limited. The availability of IVIg has also been constrained at times due to supply conditions. Currently available SCIg therapy often requires frequent administration across multiple infusion sites using an external pump to deliver the requisite volume of therapy, which presents attendant challenges to patients requiring therapy on a continuous basis. Corticosteroid therapy, though effective, has been linked with a number of well-known serious adverse events (e.g., weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis), especially with chronic use. PLEX is a specialized procedure requiring central venous access and is not universally available. The immunomodulatory therapies that may be used in CIDP are all associated with significant potential risks, including the possibility of malignancy and/or infection. For example, these include azathioprine &#8211; cytopenia; cyclosporine &#8211; hypertension, nephrotoxicity; mycophenolate &#8211; blood dyscrasias including neutropenia and red blood cell (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) aplasia; rituximab &#8211; renal toxicity; and cyclophosphamide &#8211; cardiac, pulmonary, and renal toxicity as well as bone marrow suppression and infertility. To summarize, the currently available treatments are associated with significant potential risk of adverse events, generally impose a high burden on patient&#8217;s time and effort and may be subject to restricted availability.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Batoclimab Phase 2b Trial</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the fourth quarter of calendar year 2022, we initiated a pivotal Phase 2b trial of batoclimab as a treatment for CIDP.

Patients with GD develop autoantibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (&#8220;TSHR-Ab&#8221;) present on the thyroid gland, which induces increased and uncontrolled secretion of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Because thyroid hormones play an important role in controlling functions of many organs such as heart, central and peripheral nervous system, muscle, bone, and skin, the presence of excessive thyroid hormones is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms including enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), palpitations, arrythmia, anxiety, weight loss, insomnia, osteoporosis, and pretibial myxedema. These manifestations can be mild to severe depending on the degree of thyroid hormone elevation and age. While neurogenic symptoms like anxiety and tremor are more common among younger patients, older patients tend to present with cardiovascular complications such as rapid and/or irregular heartbeat or even heart failure. The presence of TSHR-Ab is also involved in the pathogenesis of GO, also known as TED, which is more likely to occur in patients with GD who have a more severe degree of hyperthyroidism, larger goiter, history of smoking, and have been treated with radioiodine (&#8220;RAI&#8221;).</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The reported incidence and prevalence of GD varies according to the methodology applied, but it is estimated that it affects approximately 2% of women and 0.2% of men globally, with an incidence of approximately 20&#8211;40 cases per 100,000 population per year. GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and occurs at all ages but especially in adults aged between 20 and 50 years and women of reproductive age. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Current Treatment Paradigm</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The main treatment goal of GD is to reduce thyroid hormone levels. There are 3 options available: surgery, RAI, and oral antithyroid drugs (&#8220;ATDs&#8221;). Surgery, which involves removal of the entire thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) is an option, especially for patients with large goiters, women planning pregnancy, and, in some cases, patients who have failed to respond to ATDs. Although any such surgical procedure may lead to an immediate resolution of the hyperthyroidism, it is associated with a number of complications, including parathyroid gland injury, which may lead to transient or persistent hypocalcemia, and damage of the laryngeal nerve. In addition, to reduce the risk of acute complications during the procedure, patients often require pre-operative treatments to ensure cardiovascular and thyroid hormone stability.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">15</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Treatment with RAI destroys the thyroid because ionizing radiation causes deoxyribonucleic acid damage. It is considered treatment of choice in several countries, especially if ATDs are contraindicated or among patients who do not respond to this drug class. Since RAI can worsen TED, it is not recommended in patients with TED or in smokers who are at higher risk of developing TED, and in woman who are pregnant or lactating. Finally, recent data suggest an association between RAI radioiodine and several types of cancer. In the U.S., RAI has been the preferred therapy, but a trend in recent years is to increase the use of ATD and reduce the use of RAI. In addition to the potentially increased risk of cancer after RAI, an association with sustained increases in TSHR-Ab titers and risk for de novo Graves&#8217; GO and worsening of pre-existing ophthalmopathy have all been drivers of this shift in care away from RAI.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Since surgery is anatomically invasive and RAI is accompanied by exposure to radiation, both are considered more aggressive treatments than ATD. Furthermore, in addition to their invasiveness, the requirement for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy after RAI and surgery leads to a preference for ATD as a primary therapy in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The most commonly used ATDs in the U.S. are the thionamides, methimazole and propylthiouracil. While these drugs are considered generally safe, their chronic use can be associated with hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis and bone marrow toxicity. For this reason, patients need laboratory monitoring, and complete blood count and liver function tests are needed before treatment initiation. Treatment with ATD is usually administered for 12 to 18 months according to the American and European guidelines with remission rates of 50% to 55% achieved within this period. However, many patients experience a relapse after discontinuation of ATD. Younger age (&lt;40 years), TED, smoking, large thyroid volume, TSHR-Ab, and biochemically more severe disease with high hormone levels free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine significantly increase the risk of relapse of GD. A recent study showed that GD patients with persistent stimulating TSHR-Ab levels had a 6 fold increased risk for relapse after ATD withdrawal, indicating that stimulating TSHR-Ab levels are better predictors of GD relapse after ATD withdrawal than general TSHR-Abs. Collectively, these data suggest that a treatment for GD targeting the reduction or elimination of circulating stimulating TSHR-Ab would address the underlying autoimmune pathogenesis of the disease and would restore normal thyroid function.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Batoclimab Phase 2 Trial</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the second quarter of calendar year 2023, we initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial in GD in Germany.

IMVT-1402, our second anti-FcRn product candidate, has also been observed in nonclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys to reduce IgG levels to a degree similar to batoclimab. Importantly, based on the anticipated human effective dose levels, the human equivalent doses of IMVT-1402 have demonstrated minimal or no impact on levels of albumin and low-density lipoprotein (&#8220;LDL&#8221;) cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys. This is a key attribute for IMVT-1402, which we believe could potentially allow its use as a treatment of chronic conditions requiring maintenance doses that achieve high degrees of IgG suppression. We are developing batoclimab and IMVT-1402 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies would be expected to lead to clinical benefit.</span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">17</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Pharmacodynamic Data</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#333333;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In a head-to-head, placebo-controlled nonclinical study, IMVT-1402 has been observed to achieve similarly deep IgG reduction as batoclimab and have minimal or no impact on levels of albumin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at doses well above the anticipated human effective dose.

We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Johnson &amp; Johnson) and rozanolixizumab (UCB).

Subcutaneous efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme&#8217;s ENHANZE&#174; drug delivery technology. ENHANZE&#174; facilitates subcutaneous injection delivery of higher-volume biologics that are typically administered via infusion. In a Phase 2 trial conducted in MG, UCB&#8217;s rozanolixizumab was infused subcutaneously, over 30 minutes, and was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 56% and approximately 68% after three and six weekly 7 mg/kg infusions, respectively. In December 2021, UCB announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 MycarinG study evaluating rozanolixizumab in adults with gMG.

In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics&#8217; Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by AstraZeneca), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. Another C5 complement inhibitor, Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz), was approved in April 2022 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-AChR antibody-positive. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson &amp; Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, and inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, both of which are currently in Phase 3 development. In November 2022, UCB announced that its new drug application for zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG in adult patients has been accepted by the FDA.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">23</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements.

However, the patent extension granted for FDA regulatory review is only applied to a single patent that covers either the product candidate or a method of using or manufacturing the same which has not expired at the time of FDA approval. Additionally, the period of time the patent is extended may not exceed five years, and the total patent term, including the period of time the patent is extended, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The protection afforded by a patent with respect to a particular product varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in the particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent under the local laws.

A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product&#8217;s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, our product candidates are subject to the IND framework for premarket development and approval through the BLA pathway.

Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product targeting an unmet medical need is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops).

The European Commission may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year renewal period for the MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period.

During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our product candidates designed to be delivered to patients by dedicated medical devices, may be subject to E.U. requirements applicable to combination products.

The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The U.K. has unilaterally agreed to accept E.U. batch testing and batch release However, the E.U. continues to apply E.U. laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the E.U. territory.

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes the clinical protocols and general development plan, as well as results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. The FDA also may impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Submission of an IND therefore does not guarantee that FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial will be granted or that, once begun, issues will not arise that adversely impact, suspend or terminate such studies.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments and additional information such as toxicology or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (&#8220;CMC&#8221;) data in support of the investigational product(s). For new indications, a separate new IND is usually required. Outside of the U.S., clinical trial applications are generally required to conduct clinical studies in each country. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or independent data monitoring committee, which provides direction for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. </span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">29</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">www.clinicaltrials.gov</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> website.

These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to support chronic use of a product during marketing.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or, in certain circumstances, mandated after approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting or in some cases to support full approval for products that are approved via an accelerated pathway as described below. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA, and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, other regulators, and investigators within a regulated timeframe for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">in vitro</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure or adverse events reported by anti-FcRn product candidates developed by others.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. The FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">BLA Submission, Review and Approval</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">30</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA reviews the BLA within 60 days to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;), the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification or Company submissions of substantial data during the review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions with emphasis on risk and benefit of the molecule and proposed indications, and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, preclinical studies, and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, and where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter prior to inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, completion of other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, and/or conduct of additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may determine that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may require additional clinical testing or safety information.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed, which could limit the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product, and could include medication guides, healthcare professional and/or patient communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA will evaluate if any labeling or risk management plans are necessary to ensure safe use of the product in the targeted patient population and indication. Once approved, the FDA has the authority to withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre-and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may impose post-marketing requirements and commitments such as additional manufacturing data or testing; additional preclinical data or evaluation; additional clinical data from Phase 3 studies (e.g. long-term extension data); and may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Expedited Development and Review Programs and other Marketing Authorization Procedures</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">31</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation means the FDA&#8217;s goal under PDUFA is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of a product, and also provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team. The FDA may also review complete sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the entire application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The review clock generally does not begin until the final section of the BLA is submitted.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA will take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a validated surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival, irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Approval may be withdrawn if the confirmatory study does not verify the anticipated clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which the sponsor must plan to provide all commercial materials and seek approval prior to the launch of the product.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened.

Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the E.U. or, if there is, the new medicinal product will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the E.U., a &#8220;conditional&#8221; MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The European Commission may grant a conditional MA for a medicinal product if it is demonstrated that all of the following criteria are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization; (iii) the medicinal product fulfils an unmet medical need; and (iv) the benefit of the immediate availability to patients of the medicinal product is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled. Once any pending studies are provided, the conditional MA can be converted into a traditional MA.

These circumstances may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the state of scientific knowledge at that time, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. Like a conditional MA, an MA granted in exceptional circumstances is reserved to medicinal products intended to be authorized for treatment of rare diseases or unmet medical needs for which the applicant does not hold a complete data set that is required for the grant of a standard MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, an applicant for authorization in exceptional circumstances is not subsequently required to provide the missing data. Although the MA &#8220;under exceptional circumstances&#8221; is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually, and the MA will be withdrawn if the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Orphan Drug Designation</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the E.U., Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that: (i) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (ii) either (a) such conditions affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the E.U. when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the E.U. to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the E.U., or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product.

The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (&#8220;PIP&#8221;).

It is therefore possible that conditions that were or would have been designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain prior to the end of the Transition Period are or would no longer be and that conditions that were not or would not have been designated as orphan conditions in the E.U. will be designated as such in Great Britain.

The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO may grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures provided in the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Furthermore, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients.

For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and transparency, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to certain of these laws.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and, for example, prescribers, purchasers, third party payors, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from the reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are interpreted narrowly by enforcement authorities, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending any product payable by the federal health care programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, where an arrangement does not clearly meet the terms of an applicable exception or safe harbor, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on prudential factors that authorities, including the HHS of Inspector General, utilize to determine whether a particular arrangement poses a risk of fraud and abuse to the federal health care programs (e.g., increasing costs to government payors). Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, and we cannot rule out the possibility that enforcement authorities, including the Office of Inspector General, could scrutinize our practices in the future.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) (discussed below).</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">37</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The federal false claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.

It is not clear that third party payors will accept the pharmacoeconomic benefits of products that we commercialize, and we also may need to undertake detailed studies of any therapies that we commercialize in order to demonstrate their pharmacoeconomic benefits, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals.

There is no assurance of coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products under either government programs or from commercial payors. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

In the E.U., pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, some E.U. Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other E.U. Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many E.U. Member States have increased the amount of discounts that pharmaceutical companies are required to offer. These efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products onto national markets. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, some EEA countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies. This Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, process is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual E.U. Member States. In December 2021, the E.U. HTA Regulation was adopted. The purpose of the Regulation is to introduce joint clinical assessments at E.U. level.

By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;) included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate.&#8221; In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act mandated &#8220;Cadillac&#8221; tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the &#8220;individual mandate&#8221; was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration withdrew the federal government&#8217;s support for overturning the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug&#8217;s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how any future challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is also unclear.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2032 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, &#8220;Promoting Competition in the American Economy,&#8221; with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden&#8217;s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, in response to the Biden administration&#8217;s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">42</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product.

The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.

The most commonly reported AE in our Phase 1 clinical trial was mild erythema and swelling at the injection site, which typically resolved within hours. We voluntarily paused dosing in our early phase clinical studies of batoclimab to evaluate treatment-induced elevations in total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects. After evaluation of the available safety data and following discussions with multiple regulatory authorities, we are continuing our clinical development of batoclimab. While we do not expect that increases in LDL over a short-term treatment duration would pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of batoclimab at higher doses will need to incorporate any potential unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. In addition, protocols that contain long-term treatment extensions will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities.

The FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may also find that the benefits of our product candidates in any of our target indications do not outweigh its risks, including the risks associated with elevated lipid levels and lower albumin levels, in a manner sufficient to grant regulatory approval. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming and costly and relies on the collaboration with many contract research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) and clinical trial sites.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">47</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Failures can occur at any stage of clinical trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. In addition, results from clinical trials may require further evaluation delaying the next stage of clinical development or submission of a BLA. Further, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials, and such product candidates may exhibit negative safety signals in later stage clinical trials that they did not exhibit in nonclinical or earlier-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, have suffered significant setbacks in or the discontinuation of clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding positive results in earlier trials. Likewise, the results of early nonclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, some of which were not conducted by us, may not be predictive of the results of our planned development programs and there can be no assurance that the results of studies conducted by collaborators or other third parties will be viewed favorably or are indicative of our own future trial results.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we fail to successfully complete our clinical trials of our product candidates and demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates our business, financial condition and prospects would be harmed.

as the case may be, finds deficiencies in our investigational new drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) or equivalent applications for other countries or the manner in which the clinical trials are conducted. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement and completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from our product candidates, if approved, may be delayed.

Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may make formulation or manufacturing changes to our product candidates, in which case we may need to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical studies to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions.

The FDA or other foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidates.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the FDA&#8217;s, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States&#8217;, the EMA&#8217;s, the European Commission&#8217;s and other comparable regulatory authorities&#8217; policies with respect to clinical trials may change and additional government regulations may be enacted. For instance, the regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the E.U. recently evolved. The E.U. Clinical Trials Regulation (&#8220;CTR&#8221;), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each E.U. Member State, leading to a single decision for each E.U. Member State. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all E.U. Member States concerned, and a separate assessment by each E.U. Member State with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each E.U. Member State&#8217;s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized E.U. portal. Once the clinical trial is approved, clinical study development may proceed. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose clinical trial application was made on the basis of the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors could choose to submit a clinical trial application under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. Compliance with the CTR requirements by us and our third-party service providers, such as CROs, may impact our developments plans. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In light of the entry into application of the CTR on 31 January 2022, we may be required to transition clinical trials for which we have obtained regulatory approvals in accordance with the CTD to the regulatory framework of the CTR. Transition of clinical trials governed by the CTD to the CTR will be required for clinical trials which will have at least one site active in the E.U. on 30 January 2025. A transitioning application would need to be submitted to the competent authorities of E.U. Member States through the Clinical Trials Information Systems and related regulatory approval obtained to continue the clinical trial past 30 January 2025. This would require financial, technical and human resources.

The U.K. regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing E.U. legislation (as implemented into U.K. law, through secondary legislation). However, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill published in late 2022 which is intended to remove most E.U.-derived legislation from the U.K. statute book by the end of 2023, may result in a divergence of approach between the E.U. and the U.K.</span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">49</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On January 17, 2022, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the U.K. legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched and will determine whether the U.K. chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision by the U.K. not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the E.U. may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the U.K. as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization in the E.U. for our product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the U.K.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies governing clinical trials, our development plans may be impacted.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We may encounter delays or difficulties in enrolling or be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials on our current timelines, or at all, and even once enrolled, we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or be stopped, leading to delays in our development timelines. For example, we may face difficulty enrolling or maintaining a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials for MG, TED, CIDP and GD due to existing alternative treatments available, including teprotumumab for the treatment of TED, IVIg, plasma exchange and steroids for CIDP and anti-thyroid drugs for GD, as patients may decline to enroll or decide to withdraw from our clinical trials due to the risk of receiving placebo. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial and the proportion of patients screened that meets those criteria, our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents and our ability to successfully complete prerequisite studies before enrolling certain patient populations. Our product candidates are focused in part on addressing rare autoimmune indications, and we have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, TED, CIDP and GD with limited patient pools from which to draw in order to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner, and could be faced with limited patient pools as we pursue other indications.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Furthermore, any negative results or new safety signals we may report in clinical trials of our product candidates may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials we are conducting or to resume enrolling patients once a paused clinical trial has been resumed. For example, in February 2021, we reported that we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for batoclimab due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some patients treated with batoclimab. These results may make it more difficult to recruit and retain patients for clinical trials in the future, including our ongoing and planned trials of batoclimab in MG, TED, CIDP and GD and IMVT-1402. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their drug candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Also, marketing authorization of competitors in this same class of drugs may impair our ability to enroll patients into our clinical trials, delaying or potentially preventing us from completing recruitment of one or more of our trials.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product candidates or could render further development impossible.

In addition, preclinical testing may not adequately uncover drug side effects. In particular, we cannot assure you that the reductions in IgG antibodies that we have observed to date in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of batoclimab will be observed in any future clinical trials. Likewise, positive results in interim analyses or other preliminary analyses do not ensure that the clinical trial as a whole will be successful and lack statistical significance, which further limits the reliability of such data. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in, or the discontinuation of, clinical trials, even after positive results in earlier nonclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings observed while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations in clinical trials. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">As previously disclosed, we voluntarily paused dosing in our early phase clinical studies of batoclimab to evaluate treatment-induced elevations in total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects.

Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of a BLA to the FDA or other similar applications with other relevant foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and generate product revenue. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our expectations for differentiation or the effectiveness or safety of our product candidates. The FDA has substantial discretion in the review and approval process and may disagree that our data support the differentiated claims we propose.

These anti-drug antibodies can have no effect or can neutralize the effectiveness of the protein or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. Whether anti-drug antibodies will be created and how they react can often not be predicted from nonclinical studies or clinical trials and their detection or appearance is often delayed. As a result, neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date or upon longer exposure periods, such as following more chronic administration in longer lasting clinical trials. In some cases, detection of neutralizing antibodies can even occur after pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Therefore, there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be detected in future clinical trials or at a later date upon longer exposure (including after commercialization). If anti-drug antibodies reduce or neutralize the effectiveness of any of our product candidates, the continued clinical development or receipt of marketing approval for such product candidate could be delayed or prevented and, even if such product candidate is approved, its commercial success could be limited, any of which would impair our ability to generate revenue and continue operations.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We have in-licensed the rights to batoclimab and IMVT-1402 in limited territories.

For example, there are several large and small pharmaceutical companies focused on delivering therapeutics for our targeted autoimmune disease indications, including MG, TED, CIDP and GD. We anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies or drugs that become available in the future for the treatment of our target indications. If approved, our product candidates may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. Even if a biosimilar product is less effective than our product candidates, a less effective biosimilar may be more quickly adopted by physicians and patients than our competing product candidates based upon cost or convenience. Our product candidates, if approved, are expected to present a novel therapeutic approach for MG, TED, CIDP and GD and other targeted indications and will have to compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our product candidates, if approved, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies to gain a share of some patients&#8217; discretionary budgets and to gain physicians&#8217; attention within their clinical practices. Some of the companies that may offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">53</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as batoclimab or IMVT-1402.

In January 2023, the FDA accepted for filing and granted Priority Review UCB&#8217;s Biologic License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of gMG. In December 2021, the FDA approved VYVGART&#8482; (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of gMG in adults who test positive for the anti-acetylcholine receptor (&#8220;AChR&#8221;) antibody.

In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics&#8217; Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by AstraZeneca), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of gMG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. Another C5 complement inhibitor, </span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz), was approved in April 2022 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-AChR antibody-positive. The first line of treatment for patients with TED is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson &amp; Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, and inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, both of which are currently in Phase 3 development. In November 2022, UCB announced that its new drug application for zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG in adult patients has been accepted by the FDA.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Many of our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. In December 2022, Amgen agreed to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for approximately $27.8 billion, expanding its rare disease pipeline. Competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us to participate in clinical trials because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Due to varying regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available for use to treat autoimmune diseases in some international markets than are approved for use in the U.S. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market their products.

Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for a product candidate are positive, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other country or jurisdiction outside the U.S. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation, as well as additional administrative review periods. Seeking regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our failure to maintain or continuously improve our quality management program could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of patient confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Quality management plays an essential role in contract manufacturing of drugs or drug products, conducting clinical trials, preventing defects, improving our product candidates and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.

In addition, the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions, including in some cases, a boxed warning be included in the product labeling, which could limit sales of the product. Regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities do not regulate a physician&#8217;s choice of drug treatment made in the physician&#8217;s independent medical judgment, regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the U.S. and other comparable regulations in foreign jurisdictions relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to enforcement actions and investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General and other foreign regulatory authorities alleging violations of U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws and comparable laws in foreign jurisdictions.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, later discovery of previously unknown AEs caused by our product candidates or reported by anti-FcRn product candidates developed by others, or other problems with our product, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results, including:</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">restrictions on the manufacture of such product;</span></div><div style="padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">restrictions on the labeling or marketing of such product, including a &#8220;black box&#8221;

In July 2021, we were granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. by the FDA for batoclimab for the treatment of MG and, in August 2022, we received orphan drug designation from the European Commission for batoclimab for the treatment of MG. We plan to seek orphan drug designation from the FDA for batoclimab and/or IMVT-1402 where there is a medically plausible basis for batoclimab and/or IMVT-1402&#8217;s use, as well as with respect to other product candidates we may develop. We may also seek orphan drug designation for batoclimab and/or IMVT-1402 for the treatment of other indications in the E.U. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Although we intend to seek additional orphan drug designation for batoclimab from the FDA and the European Commission, we may never receive such further designation. Moreover, obtaining orphan drug designation for batoclimab for the treatment of MG does not mean we will be able to obtain such designation for any other indications. Even if we were to obtain additional orphan drug designation for batoclimab from the FDA or the European Commission, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the same drug for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, and thus approval of batoclimab could be blocked for years if another company obtains approval and orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug and same condition before us. If we do obtain market exclusivity in the U.S. or in the E.U., it may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA or the European Commission later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of the relevant patients. Further, exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, the same drugs can be approved for different indications and might then be used off-label in our approved indication and different drugs for the same condition may already be approved and commercially available. Orphan drug designation does not convey any automatic advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the development or FDA or other foreign regulatory authority review and approval process.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we

Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, boosting pricing transparency, improving quality and/or expanding patient access and the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and related legislation (collectively, the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things: (1) introduced an &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; calculation for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and that are not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (2) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; (3) established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (4) expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (5) established a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers currently must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (6) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; (7) created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and (8) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">61</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;) was enacted, which included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate.&#8221; In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated &#8220;Cadillac&#8221; tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the "individual mandate" was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug&#8217;s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the &#8220;donut hole&#8221; under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the Affordable Care Act that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2032 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, &#8220;Promoting Competition in the American Economy,&#8221; with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden&#8217;s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, in response to the Biden administration&#8217;s October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">At the state level, individual states in the U.S. are increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">62</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product.

There is no assurance that our product candidates, if approved, would achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement levels. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidate that we develop through approval will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. Additionally, a third-party payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the drug, on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed and whether to require step therapy. The position of a drug on a formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our products, to the extent that patients who are prescribed our products, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Even if we do obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, products. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. Additionally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the U.S. and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any future drugs profitably. There can be no assurance that our product candidates, if approved, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary or cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that reimbursement policies and practices in the U.S. and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved for sale.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">63</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Many E.U. Member States periodically review their reimbursement procedures for medicinal products, which could have an adverse impact on reimbursement status. We expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the E.U. Member States will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative to branded products, and/or branded products available through parallel import to keep healthcare costs down. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some European countries, including some E.U. Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some E.U. Member States, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process, which is currently governed by national laws in each E.U. Member State, is the procedure to assess therapeutic, economic and societal impact of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. The outcome of an HTA will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual E.U. Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between E.U. Member States.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In December 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/E.U. was adopted in the E.U. This Regulation which entered into force in January 2022 and will apply as of January 2025, is intended to boost cooperation among E.U. Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at E.U. level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit E.U. Member States to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the E.U., working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual E.U. Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non- clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement status in E.U.

These measures could include limitations on the prices we would be able to charge for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the level of reimbursement available for these products from governmental authorities or third-party payors. Further, an increasing number of E.U. and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as &#8220;reference prices&#8221; to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Risks Related to Our Business, Financial Position and Capital Requirements</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Our business, operations, clinical development plans and timelines and supply chain could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics and pandemics on the manufacturing, clinical trials and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, including our contract manufacturers, CROs, suppliers, shippers and others.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our business could be adversely affected by health epidemics wherever we have clinical trial sites or other business operations. In addition, health epidemics could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs and other third parties upon whom we rely. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. Many geographic regions imposed, or in the future may impose or re-impose, &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants. Our headquarters is located in New York City, we have business operations in North Carolina and our contract manufacturers are located in the U.S. and in South Korea. At present, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all employees. The effects of our work-from-home policy, including any plans to return to the office, may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">64</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We are dependent on a worldwide supply chain for products to be used in our clinical trials and, if approved by the regulatory authorities, for commercialization. Quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the expectation that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions could occur or re-occur, whether related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and other countries or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our supply chain. For example, any manufacturing supply interruption of batoclimab, which is currently manufactured at facilities in the U.S. and in South Korea, or IMVT-1402 or any future product candidates, could adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials of batoclimab, IMVT-1402 and any future product candidates.

Switching or adding additional suppliers or vendors involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new supplier or vendor commences work. As a result, delays generally occur, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any future commercialization timelines. Although we strive to carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.

For example, clinical trial sites have experienced limited capacity and staffing shortages in a post-COVID 19 environment, partially due to personnel having been reassigned during the pandemic, resulting in a backlog of patient enrollment and delayed site initiations across the industry.

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy protections. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA are far-reaching and may require us to modify our Processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. For example, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches and statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per violation, which is expected to increase data breach class action litigation and result in significant exposure to costly legal judgements and settlements. The CCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;) becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA&#8217;s private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16 and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. While certain clinical trial activities are exempt from the CCPA&#8217;s requirements, other personal information that we handle may be subject to the CCPA, which may increase our compliance costs, exposure to regulatory enforcement action and other liabilities. Virginia has similarly enacted a comprehensive privacy law, the Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado recently enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, and Utah recently passed the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all laws of which emulate the CCPA and CPRA in many respects. Further, proposals for comprehensive privacy, data protection, and information security legislation are advancing in several other states. A patchwork of differing laws would increase the cost and complexity of operating our business and increase our exposure to liability.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various foreign jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) went into effect in the EEA. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires us to give more detailed disclosures about how we collect, use and share personal information, contractually commit to data protection measures in our contracts with clients, maintain adequate data security measures, notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches, meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements and honor individuals&#8217; data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information. The GDPR provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions on data processing and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers&#8217;, partners&#8217;, or vendors&#8217; failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our product and services or conduct clinical trials in the EEA. We may also be obligated to assist our customers, partners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR, which could require expenditure of significant resources. Assisting our customers, partners, and vendors in complying with the GDPR or complying with the GDPR ourselves may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the regulation of data transfers between the EEA and U.K. remains subject to post-Brexit uncertainty. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision under the GDPR which allows transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.K. to continue without restriction for a period of four years ending June 27, 2025. During these four years, the European Commission will continue to monitor the legal situation in the U.K. and can intervene if the U.K. deviates from the level of data protection in place at the time of issuance of the adequacy decision. If the adequacy decision is withdrawn or not renewed, transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.K. will require a valid transfer mechanism and companies making such transfers may be required to implement new processes and put new agreements in place to continue making such transfers. Additionally, although U.K. privacy, data protection and information security law is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated notwithstanding Brexit.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">72</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. A decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (the Schrems II ruling) has invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which was one of the primary mechanisms used by U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe. Similarly, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is inadequate for transfers of data from Switzerland to the U.S. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new Standard Contractual Clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;) that are designed to be a mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. Currently, the SCCs are a valid mechanism to transfer personal information outside of the EEA. The SCCs, however, require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the transferred personal information. Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, uncertainty exists regarding whether the SCCs will remain a valid mechanism. The new SCCs may increase the legal risks and liabilities under European privacy, data protection, and information security laws. Given that, at present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the SCCs, any transfers by us or our vendors of personal information from Europe may not comply with European data protection laws, which may increase our exposure to European data protection laws&#8217; heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions and may prohibit our transfer of European personal information outside of Europe (including clinical trial data), and may adversely impact our operations, product development and ability to provide our products. The U.K. is not subject to the European Commission&#8217;s revised SCCs but has published its own transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement (&#8220;IDTA&#8221;), which enables transfers from the U.K. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. In addition, additional measures may be required even when relying on SCCs or the IDTA, where the laws of the importer&#8217;s country do not offer an adequate level of protection, such as the U.S. Use of SCCs and IDTA must consequently be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On March 25, 2022, the European Commission and the U.S. announced that they had agreed, in principle, on a successor of the previously invalidated Privacy Shield Framework, the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on &#8220;Enhancing Safeguards for U.S. Signals Intelligence Activities&#8221;. The European Commission is now preparing a draft adequacy decision for adoption that takes into account the Executive Order. However, a related adoption is not expected before spring 2023 and it is remained to be seen whether the new adequacy decision would withstand scrutiny by the CJEU if the adequacy decision&#8217;s validity was to be challenged.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Further, the risk of GDPR litigation may increase because of a recent decision of the CJEU.

Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and biologics or modifications to approved drugs and biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government authorities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Separately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA adopted a risk-based approach to the inspection of foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities and similar restrictions.

For example, the Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Higher interest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending. Similarly, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. Any such volatility and disruptions may adversely affect our business or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive.

We rely on third parties to produce clinical supplies and commercial supplies of batoclimab and IMVT-1402. For example, in November 2021, we entered into an agreement with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. to manufacture and supply us with batoclimab drug substance for commercial sale and perform other manufacturing-related services with respect to batoclimab. Additional third-party vendors may be difficult to identify for our product candidate process and formulation development and manufacturing due to special capabilities required, and they may not be able to meet our quality standards. Any significant delay in the supply of batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or the raw material components thereof, or in placebo controls for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidate. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidate, the commercial launch of such product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of such product candidate. In addition, batoclimab and IMVT-1402 are biologics and require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Accordingly, multiple steps are needed to control the manufacturing processes. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program to monitor the manufacturing processes used by third-party manufacturers and our reliance on third-party manufacturers does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process or from the materials used in the manufacturing process, which may not be detectable by us in a timely manner, could lead to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient inventory. A quality or safety issue emanating from manufacturing failures may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, monetary sanctions, injunction to halt manufacture and distribution of drugs or drug products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidate must be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to foreign regulatory authorities. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidate. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidate, if approved.

The regulatory authorities enforce GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. Although we rely on CROs to conduct our GLP-compliant nonclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Therefore, the success of our clinical trials depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program to monitor our CROs&#8217; compliance with applicable regulations. If we or our CROs fail to comply with GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may reject our marketing applications or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Accordingly, if we or our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or other applicable laws, regulations or standards, or fail to recruit a sufficient number of subjects, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the relevant regulatory approval process. Failure by our CROs to properly execute study protocols in accordance with applicable law could also create product liability and regulatory risks for us as sponsors of those studies. Further, our or our CROs&#8217; inability to address a quality or safety issue may result in, among others, adverse inspection reports, warning letters, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">78</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">While we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs are not our employees, and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and nonclinical programs.

Any of these changes could cause batoclimab or any future product candidate to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval or similar.

New biologics, such as batoclimab or IMVT-1402, may be entitled to regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA. The BPCIA grants new biologics 12 years of FDA-granted exclusivity. Further, under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. During the period of exclusivity, however, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor&#8217;s own clinical data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, the FDA can approve a biosimilar product through an abbreviated approval process.

However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">79</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidates or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We rely, and will continue to rely, upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors and other third parties to protect the intellectual property related to our brand, current and future drug development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to batoclimab, IMVT-1402 and any future product candidates and their uses. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad in the Licensed Territory related to our current and future drug development programs and product candidates, successfully defending our intellectual property rights against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent third-party infringement.

We generally apply for patents in those countries in the Licensed Territory where we intend to make, have made, use, offer for sale or sell products and where we assess the risk of infringement to justify the cost of seeking patent protection. However, we do not seek protection in all countries where we intend to sell products and we may not accurately predict all the countries where patent protection would ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date.

There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application or be used to invalidate an issued patent. The examination process may require us to narrow our claims, which may limit the scope of any patent protection we obtain. Even if patents do successfully issue based on our patent applications and even if such patents cover our product candidates, uses of our product candidates or other aspects related to our product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, ownership, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our product candidates, if approved, and technologies. Other companies may also design around our patents. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our product candidates, if approved, or practicing our own patented technology. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate while under patent protection could be reduced. If any of our patents expire or are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise limited by third parties prior to the commercialization of our product candidates and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to other enforceable patents protecting our product candidates, competitors and other third parties could market products that are substantially similar to ours and our business would suffer.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and our product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, batoclimab and IMVT-1402, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop our product candidates and threaten our ability to commercialize future drugs.

For example, the Leahy Smith America Invents Act (the &#8220;Leahy-Smith Act&#8221;) was signed into law in 2011 and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter party review, and derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the U.S. transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not until a patent issues. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">inter partes</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our owned or licensed patent rights.

Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products or limit the duration of the patent protection of our products. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or any future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">81</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">The validity, scope and enforceability of any patents that cover a biologic subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as batoclimab, can be challenged by third parties.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For biologics subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as batoclimab or IMVT-1402, the BPCIA provides a mechanism for one or more third parties to seek FDA approval to manufacture or sell a biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products.

After the exchange of this information, we may then initiate a lawsuit within 30 days to defend the patents identified in the exchange. If the biosimilar applicant successfully challenges the asserted patent claims it could result in the invalidation of or render unenforceable some or all of the relevant patent claims or result in a finding of non-infringement.

In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect patent rights to the same extent as federal laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S. or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in certain jurisdictions. Competitors may exploit our inventions in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we may obtain patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.

This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">82</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:112%">Patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. The patent family directed to the composition of matter of batoclimab has a natural projected expiration date in 2035 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The patent family directed to the composition of matter of IMVT-1402 and its use in treating autoimmune diseases has a natural projected expiration date in 2043 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The patent family directed to the formulation of batoclimab has a natural projected expiration date in 2041 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The patent family directed to the use of batoclimab for treating TED has a natural projected expiration date in 2039 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The patent families directed to the use of batoclimab and IMVT-1402 for treating GD and the use of batoclimab and IMVT-1402 for treating CIDP each have a natural projected expiration date in 2043 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The patent family directed to the method of manufacturing of, and formulations produced by such method, covering manufacturing and formulations of batoclimab, has a natural projected expiration date in 2044 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of any new product candidate, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">If we are not able to obtain patent term extension in the U.S. under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or other product candidates that we may identify, our business may be harmed.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, product candidates and our target indications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of batoclimab or other product candidates that we may identify, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221;). The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA premarket regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries, including the E.U., upon regulatory approval of our product candidates, based on similar legislation. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the U.S. or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">It is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or other product candidates that we may identify even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a shorter period than we had sought. Further, for patents we may later in-license or jointly own, we may not have the right to control patent prosecution, including filing with the USPTO a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of these patents was eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we might not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension would be filed or obtained from the USPTO.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">83</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We do not have rights to protect intellectual property in certain territories and may be unable to adequately protect our rights.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We do not have rights to develop, manufacture, use or commercialize batoclimab, IMVT-1402 or other assets licensed from HanAll in jurisdictions outside the Licensed Territory.

The standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. Further, even if we prevail against an infringer in U.S. district court, there is always the risk that the infringer will file an appeal and the district court judgment will be overturned at the appeals court and/or that an adverse decision will be issued by the appeals court relating to the validity or enforceability of our patents. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in a manner insufficient to achieve our business objectives or could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.

In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of written description or statutory subject matter.

that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. For example, we currently have one such putative class-action complaint brought against us. We could incur substantial costs defending this or similar lawsuits, as well as diversion of the time and attention of our management, any or all of which could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, the stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions, increased inflation and other adverse effects or developments, including political, regulatory and other market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price of shares of our common stock may decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention and adversely impact our business.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.

This or any future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. See Part II, Item 1.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes Oxley Act"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in future uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">We qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; within the meaning of the Exchange Act and are taking advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies, which could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in the Exchange Act.

Further, ISL is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K., and, under current U. K. tax law, a company which is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. is regarded as resident in the U.K. for taxation purposes. Accordingly, we expect ISL to be subject to U.K. taxation on its income and gains and subject to the U.K.&#8217;s controlled foreign company rules, except where an exemption applies. ISL may be treated as a dual resident company for U.K. tax purposes. As a result, ISL&#8217;s right to claim certain reliefs from U.K. tax may be restricted, and changes in law or practice in the U.K. could result in the imposition of further restrictions on ISL&#8217;s right to claim U.K. tax reliefs. ISL may also become subject to income, withholding or other taxes in certain jurisdictions by reason of its activities and operations, and it is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert that ISL is subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate.

In that case, our corporate structure and intercompany transactions, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, will be organized so that we can achieve our business objectives in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules and regulations. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries or tax jurisdictions, the tax laws and regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms&#8217; length and that appropriate documentation be maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms&#8217; length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">96</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we intend to operate in numerous countries and taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views for instance with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm&#8217;s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Moreover, certain relevant tax, accounting and other laws have special application with respect to &#8220;affiliated,&#8221; &#8220;combined&#8221; or similar groups, which may include RSL, ISL and their respective subsidiaries and which may impact the tax liabilities of the companies. We continue to assess the impact of such changes in tax laws on our business and may determine that changes to our structure, practice or tax positions are necessary in light of such changes and developments in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such changes may nevertheless be ineffective in avoiding an increase in our consolidated tax liability, which could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Changes in tax laws or our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">New income, sales, use, excise or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect us. Further, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in existing tax rates, tax laws, tax practice, tax treaties or tax regulations or changes in the interpretation thereof by the tax authorities in Europe (including the U.K. and Switzerland), the U.S., Bermuda and other jurisdictions as well as being affected by certain international tax developments, including certain changes currently proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) and their action plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (&#8220;BEPS&#8221;), as well as other initiatives led by the OECD and the European Commission. For example, the OECD is leading work on proposals, commonly referred to as &#8220;BEPS 2.0&#8221;, which, if implemented, would make important changes to the international tax system. These proposals are based on two &#8220;pillars&#8221;, involving the allocation of taxing rights in respect of certain multinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as the Pillar One proposal) and imposing a minimum effective tax rate on certain multinational enterprises (referred to as the Pillar Two proposal). The E.U. has adopted a Council Directive requiring aspects of the Pillar Two proposal to be transposed into the national laws of E.U. Member States by December 31, 2023, and a number of other countries (including, the U.K. and Switzerland) are also planning to enact (or are in the process of enacting) such rules, which could increase our tax obligations in the countries where we do business. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Failure to manage the risks associated with international tax changes, or misinterpretation of the laws providing such changes, could result in costly audits, interest, penalties and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, results of our operations and our financial condition. In addition, changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations or other U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder could adversely affect our effective tax rate. For example, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes provisions that will impact the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations, including imposing a minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and an excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases that would be imposed on the corporation repurchasing such stock.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.

Our innovative product pipeline includes batoclimab, formerly referred to as IMVT-1401, and IMVT-1402, both of which are novel, fully human monoclonal antibodies that target the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (&#8220;FcRn&#8221;). Batoclimab and IMVT-1402 are the result of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by us and HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd., (&#8220;HanAll&#8221;) to design highly potent anti-FcRn antibodies that may be optimized as a simple, subcutaneous injection with dosing that we believe can be tailored based on disease severity and stage. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Batoclimab, our first product candidate, has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, batoclimab has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G (&#8220;IgG&#8221;) antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe batoclimab has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Likewise, IMVT-1402, our second product candidate, has also been observed in nonclinical studies to reduce IgG antibody levels. Importantly, based on the anticipated human effective dose levels, the human equivalent doses of IMVT-1402 have demonstrated minimal or no impact on levels of albumin and low-density lipoprotein (&#8220;LDL&#8221;) cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys. This is a key attribute for IMVT-1402, which we believe could potentially allow its use as a treatment of chronic conditions requiring maintenance doses that achieve high degrees of IgG suppression. We are developing batoclimab and IMVT-1402 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Based on third-party patient prevalence estimates, for the 22 indications that have been announced by multiple companies for clinical development with anti-FcRn assets, we estimate the total potential opportunity for our FcRn franchise to be greater than two million patients in the U.S. and Europe (includes all European Union countries, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland). We are currently developing batoclimab for myasthenia gravis (&#8220;MG&#8221;), thyroid eye disease (&#8220;TED&#8221;), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (&#8220;CIDP&#8221;) and Graves&#8217; disease (&#8220;GD&#8221;). As a result of our rational design and current outlook on potential opportunities, we believe that batoclimab and IMVT-1402, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To the extent we choose to develop batoclimab and IMVT-1402 as potential treatments for certain of these and other rare diseases, we plan to seek orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe, where applicable. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. In August 2022, we were granted orphan drug designation from the European Commission for batoclimab for the treatment of MG. Previously, batoclimab received orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) for the treatment of MG. We plan to seek orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for batoclimab and/or IMVT-1402 in other indications where there is a medically plausible basis for batoclimab and/or IMVT-1402&#8217;s use.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div style="height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">101</span></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"/><div style="min-height:42.75pt;width:100%"><div><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline"><a style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;text-decoration:underline" href="#ie2f15117e1a842369857393e18b72812_7">Table of Contents</a></span></div></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For IMVT-1402, our next generation FcRn inhibitor, in the second quarter of calendar year 2023, the FDA cleared our IND application for IMVT-1402 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in in healthy volunteers in New Zealand after approval of the CTA by the regulatory authority, MEDSAFE.

These royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the latest of: (A)&#160;the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents expire, (B)&#160;the date on which the data or market exclusivity expires or (C) 11 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product, in each case, with respect to a given product in a given country. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Product Service Agreement and Master Services Agreement</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">On November 17, 2021, Immunovant, Inc.&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, ISG, entered into a Product Service Agreement, (&#8220;PSA&#8221;) with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd., (&#8220;Samsung&#8221;), pursuant to which Samsung will manufacture and supply us with batoclimab drug substance for commercial, if approved, sale and perform other manufacturing-related services with respect to batoclimab. We previously entered in a Master Services Agreement, (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) with Samsung, dated April 30, 2021, which governs certain terms of our relationship with Samsung. Upon execution of the PSA, we committed to purchase process performance qualification batches of batoclimab and pre-approval inspection batches of batoclimab which may be used for regulatory submissions and, pending regulatory approval, commercial sale. In addition to these, we are obligated to purchase additional batches of batoclimab in the four-year period of 2026 through 2029.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The PSA will continue until the later of December 31, 2029 or the completion of the services thereunder, unless the PSA is terminated earlier. If we make a final decision to stop all development of batoclimab and all attempts to obtain regulatory approval for batoclimab, then we will have the right to terminate the PSA with 30 days&#8217; written notice to Samsung as long as such notice is provided no later than January 2024. Upon such termination of the PSA, we will pay Samsung for non-cancellable service fees and costs that Samsung incurs and for all batches of batoclimab scheduled to be manufactured during the two-year period following such termination. In addition, either party may terminate the PSA on account of (i) the other party&#8217;s material breach of the PSA that is not cured within a specified period after the termination notice, (ii) the other party&#8217;s insolvency or bankruptcy, or (iii) certain force majeure events.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The remaining minimum purchase commitment related to this agreement was estimated to be approximately $33.3 million as of March 31, 2023.

In addition, in the second quarter of calendar year 2023, the FDA cleared our IND application for IMVT-1402 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of IMVT-1402 in healthy volunteers in New Zealand after approval of the CTA by the regulatory authority, MEDSAFE.

This increase reflected $19.1 million of upfront and start-up costs related to our Phase 2b trial of batoclimab as a treatment for CIDP and $18.7 million of upfront and start-up costs related to our Phase 3 trial for batoclimab as a treatment for MG, including higher contract manufacturing costs for process development and drug substance manufacturing in preparation for process performance qualification activities for each indication. Also contributing to the increase were $4.8 million of start-up costs for TED due to the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical program. Partially offsetting these increases were lower contract manufacturing costs and clinical activities of $6.9 million in Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, primarily as a result of our strategic decision not to pursue this indication for batoclimab.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">For the year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $10.3 and $9.9 million, respectively, of research and development costs related to the development of IMVT-1402, primarily related to pre-clinical studies and contract manufacturing costs.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Unallocated research and development costs increased by $21.7 million, from $49.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 to $71.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2023.

We assessed the historical accuracy of the clinical trial accrual and analyzed the underlying data to evaluate changes in the clinical trial accrual that would result from reasonable changes in the underlying data. To evaluate the completeness of the accruals, we also examined subsequent invoices from the service providers and cash disbursements to the service providers, to the extent such invoices were

The Company accrues for all contingencies at the earliest date at which the Company deems it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the Company accrues the minimum of the range. In the cases where the Company believes that a reasonably possible loss exists, the Company discloses the facts and circumstances of the litigation, including an estimable range, if possible. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. Additionally, the Company records a receivable for rights to insurance recoveries, limited to the extent of incurred or probable losses, when such recoveries have been agreed to with third-party insurers and when receipt is deemed probable.

Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the &#8220;simplified method&#8221; with the continued use of this method extended until such time the Company has sufficient exercise history. The expected share price volatility for the Company&#8217;s common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for the Company&#8217;s peers. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the equity award. As the Company has never paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be <ix:nonFraction unitRef="number" contextRef="ic9f28dec7d474a71b88ae736d87699dd_D20220401-20230331" decimals="INF" name="us-gaap:ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsExpectedDividendRate" format="ixt:fixed-zero" scale="-2" id="id3VybDovL2RvY3MudjEvZG9jOmUyZjE1MTE3ZTFhODQyMzY5ODU3MzkzZTE4YjcyODEyL3NlYzplMmYxNTExN2UxYTg0MjM2OTg1NzM5M2UxOGI3MjgxMl8xMDAvZnJhZzplZTc2Y2EwZmEwZWM0NWQ4OGQwMGI3YjhmMDI2NTdmMC90ZXh0cmVnaW9uOmVlNzZjYTBmYTBlYzQ1ZDg4ZDAwYjdiOGYwMjY1N2YwXzE0MTU3_436e6bbe-ab05-4cc4-bd8f-d704013c7877">zero</ix:nonFraction>.

The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making false and misleading statements regarding the safety of batoclimab and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees. On December 29, 2021, the U.S. District Court appointed a lead plaintiff. On February 1, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding RSL and the Company&#8217;s directors and underwriters as defendants (collectively, &#8220;Defendants&#8221;), and asserting additional claims under Section 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 on behalf of a putative class consisting of those who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company&#8217;s securities pursuant and/or traceable to the Company&#8217;s follow-on public offering on or about September 2, 2020. On March 15, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed a further amended complaint. On February 14, 2023, the Court granted lead plaintiffs leave to amend. On March 17, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. The Company and other Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on April 28, 2023. Plaintiff&#8217;s opposition is due on June 9, 2023, and Defendants&#8217; replies are due on June 30, 2023, at which point Defendants intend to file the fully briefed motions to dismiss. No hearing date has been set on the motion to dismiss. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend the case and has not recorded a liability related to this lawsuit because, at this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible losses or determine whether an unfavorable outcome is either probable or remote.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Commitments</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During the year ended March&#160;31, 2023, ISG entered into the PSA with Samsung to manufacture a certain quantity of batoclimab drug substance for, among other things, commercial sale, if approved.
