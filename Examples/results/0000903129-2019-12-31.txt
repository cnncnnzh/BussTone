Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws

[-0.5274065136909485, -1.3484019041061401, 2.311527729034424]

 In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance

[-1.6628283262252808, 1.8865264654159546, 0.5450838804244995]

 The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices

[-1.9098718166351318, 2.597008228302002, 0.025517065078020096]

 Furthermore, the CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts

 Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, fail to prevent fraud and adversely affect the market price of our common stock
