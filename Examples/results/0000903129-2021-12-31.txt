 In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance

[-1.6628283262252808, 1.8865264654159546, 0.5450838804244995]

 The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices

  The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts

 Furthermore, in November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed as a ballot measure

[0.3709455728530884, -2.294010877609253, 2.062687397003174]

 While many of the CPRA’s substantive modifications will not go into effect until 2023, they will require businesses to dedicate time and resources on compliance efforts, in some cases requiring new or modified practices and operations
