 State attorneys general can enforce such state laws and can seek equitable as well as monetary remedies and in some cases private rights of action are permitted by such laws.

 •The New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) has enacted extensive regulatory requirements applicable to CRAs that require registration with that agency, prohibit unfair and deceptive consumer practices and require compliance with significant portions of the NYDFS cybersecurity rules.

 10•We or certain of our operations are also subject to and affected by new and evolving state privacy and data security laws such as data broker registration requirements in California and Vermont, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

 The CCPA became effective January 1, 2020 and imposes additional data privacy requirements on many businesses operating in the state, including, potentially, with respect to employee data in addition to consumer data.

 The CCPA expansively defines “personal information” and imposes new notice requirements relating to the collection, use and sharing of personal information.

 The CCPA expansively defines “personal information” and imposes new notice requirements relating to the collection, use and sharing of personal information.

 It provides consumers with extensive rights, including the right to access the categories and specific pieces of personal information businesses collect, the right to request businesses delete information, and the right to opt-out of “sales” of personal information with sales being defined under the CCPA to include monetary and non-monetary valuable consideration.

 In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which maintains the core framework but expands the requirements of the CCPA effective January 1, 2023.

 We may also become subject to and affected by new and proposed state privacy laws similar to the CCPA and CPRA, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) which becomes effective January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) which becomes effective July 1, 2023.

 A number of other state legislatures, including New York, Florida and Washington, have introduced comprehensive data privacy legislation modeled after, and which contain certain elements of, the CCPA, VCDPA or the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which is an extremely broad privacy law.

 If enacted, such laws may contain variations and impose new compliance risks and obligations on us.

 These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business.

 In addition, new laws and regulations at the state and federal level are enacted or considered frequently.

 Examples of such new and evolving laws and regulations include amendments to the FCRA requiring the provision of free credit freezes to consumers, cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the New York Department of Financial Services, the CCPA which took effect on January 1, 2020, the California data broker registration requirements that took effect on January 31, 2020, and the CPRA and VCDPA each taking effect on January 1, 2023.

 Furthermore, we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business, including by the current U.

S.

 The Canadian government has initiated a review of consumer privacy laws, and several U.

S.

 states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the CCPA and/or the GDPR.

 Compliance with multiple state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly.

 In Europe, although the GDPR already includes certain provisions relating to the automated processing of personal data, there has also been discussion of new legislative proposals to regulate business use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies which, if enacted, could impose new legal requirements addressing among other issues, privacy, discrimination and human rights.
