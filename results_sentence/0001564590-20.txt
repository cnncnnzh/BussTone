 In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018 for all European Union (“EU”) member states.

 The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of EU residents that are partially different from those previously in place and includes significant penalties for non-compliance.

 In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020 and many other states are in various stages of implementing privacy legislation.

 The CCPA provides California residents with specific privacy rights including a new private right of action for certain data breaches.
