 For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to us and creates a range of requirements and compliance obligations regarding the treatment of personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance.

 The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, among other things, imposes additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of California residents.

 The CCPA provides civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.

 The GDPR, the CCPA, the recently approved California Privacy Rights Act, and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of non-compliance, which could result in substantial penalties, negative publicity and harm to our brand.

[-1.6651743650436401, 2.7308080196380615, -0.7584062218666077]

 It is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability, require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries.

 As a result, our reputation and brand, which are critical to our business operations, may be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, including costs related to litigation, or we could lose both customers and revenue.
