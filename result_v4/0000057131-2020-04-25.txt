Foreign jurisdictions, as well as the United States federal and state governments, are increasingly enacting laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.

 These laws and regulations are emerging and continuously evolving and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and changing.

 For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to us and creates a range of requirements and compliance obligations regarding the treatment of personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance.

 The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, among other things, imposes additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of California residents.

 The CCPA provides civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.

[-1.1401336193084717, -0.4473011791706085, 2.2966063022613525]

 GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of non-compliance, which could result in substantial penalties.

[-1.5024901628494263, 2.6526143550872803, -0.8856324553489685]

 It is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability, require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries.

[-1.7578102350234985, 1.5480509996414185, 1.157938838005066]

 As a result, our reputation and brand, which is critical to our business operations, may be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, or we could lose both customers and revenue.
