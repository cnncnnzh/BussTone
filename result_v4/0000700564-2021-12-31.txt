 For example, the CCPA gives California residents new rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of "Personal Information," as well as rights to access, delete, and restrict the sale of certain personal information.

[-0.1552726775407791, -1.8745542764663696, 2.073270320892334]

 The CCPA, which was amended in November 2020 by a ballot initiative titled the California Privacy Rights Act, went into effect on January 1, 2020, and Fulton Bank is required to comply with the CCPA in serving the small number of its customers that are residents of California.

 Privacy and data security legislation remained a priority issue in 2021.

[0.31717514991760254, -1.9386738538742065, 1.8561092615127563]

 Attempts by state and local governments to regulate consumer privacy have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations.

 In addition, Congress and federal regulatory agencies are considering similar laws or regulations that could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data.

[0.19271357357501984, -1.559921383857727, 1.6304752826690674]

 For example, on November 23, 2021, the federal financial regulatory agencies published a final rule that will impose on banking organizations and their service providers new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents.

[-0.915412962436676, -0.24042582511901855, 1.66820228099823]

 Specifically, the final rule requires banking organizations to promptly notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the discovery of a "computer security incident" that rises to the level of a "notification incident" within the meaning attributed to those terms by the final rule.

[-1.1568444967269897, -0.41646748781204224, 2.28403902053833]

 Banksâ€™ services providers are required under the final rule to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services "as soon as possible" after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided to such bank for four or more hours.
